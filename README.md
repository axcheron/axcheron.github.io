# BreakInSecurity

This is the source code of my blog. It is based on [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. 

**Compatible with Jekyll 3.5 and up.**

You can visit my blog [here](https://axcheron.github.io).

### Running Jekyll (Local Testing)

First you have to run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Make sure to use the last version of bundler by updating the gem via `gem install bundler`. 

> **Note:** On macOS, you can easily install *Ruby* by using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and running the command `brew install ruby`.

If `jekyll build` and `jekyll serve` throw errors you may have to run Jekyll with `bundle exec` instead.

In some cases, running executables without `bundle exec` may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.

However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll build

$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

> **Note:** When testing locally I recommend `url: "http://localhost:4000"` to keep paths pointing to local pages and assets. Ideally youâ€™d use multiple config files with `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml` to apply development overrides.
