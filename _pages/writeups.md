Here is a list of some write-ups I have done. I hope it will help you to get a better understanding of how to exploit vulnerabilities in the various field of information security.

I left the passwords in cleartext for each level because, if you google it, you'll find them anyway... But, try to do it yourself because "It's not about the destination; it's about the journey".

## MBE - Modern Binary Exploitation 

[Modern Binary Exploitation (MBE)](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE) is a free course developed and used by [RPISEC](http://rpis.ec) to teach Modern Binary Exploitation at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu). It covers basic x86 reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, and classical forms of Linux-based userland binary exploitation. It also focus on protections found on modern systems and the techniques used to defeat them. This course come with a large number of labs that I'll explain in this write-up.

## DVWA - Damn Vulnerable Web Application

[Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA)](https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.

>**Note:** This write-up is constantly evolving. I will add solutions on the various levels as soon as possible.
