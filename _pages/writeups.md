## MBE - Modern Binary Exploitation 

[Modern Binary Exploitation (MBE)](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE) is a free course developed and used by [RPISEC](http://rpis.ec) to teach Modern Binary Exploitation at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu). It covers basic x86 reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, and classical forms of Linux-based userland binary exploitation. It also focuses on protections found on modern systems and the techniques used to defeat them. This course comes with a large number of labs that I'll explain in this write-up.
