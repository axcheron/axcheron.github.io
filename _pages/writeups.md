Here is a list of some write-ups I have done. I hope it will help you to get a better understanding of how to exploit vulnerabilities in the various field of information security.

## DVWA - Damn Vulnerable Web Application

[Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA)](https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.
