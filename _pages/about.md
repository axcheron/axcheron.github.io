We live in the **Digital Age**, we grow up around computers, cameras, smartphones and other digital technologies. Nowadays computers are so small that they are embedded in our [clothes](http://www.omsignal.com), we carry them in our [pockets](https://www.google.com/nexus/) or even wear them as [jewelry](https://www.apple.com/watch/). But all these devices are quite complex and most of us struggle to fully understand them and use them properly.

The question that now arises is: *What about security and privacy ?*

Well, this is the main topic of this blog, mostly on a technical standpoint. For 10 years now, I study the security around computers, networks and devices in order to bypass it. By creating this blog, I want to share, among other things, my projects, techniques, hacks and discoveries. Because **Hacking** is about **Sharing**, but it's also about getting a better understanding of the technologies that we use every day.


## About me

I'm just another hacker, working as a penetration tester. Over the past 10 years, I split my time between researching, consulting, and training students and security professional on a wide range of topics related to offensive security and computer networks.
